* It's not cricket. Non-cricket sports have generally not been broadcast unless super important
* It's women's game. Great to see women's matches being broadcast.
* It's U17. It's not even the top level side.
* It's a domestic match. It's not some FIFA WC Qualifier.

Other than that, more domestic cricket matches are being streamed now. Today a few SMA trophy matches were streamed and an U19 match vs Nepal was streamed.

Hockey Olympic qualifiers were also streamed, for both men and women.

Pro Kabaddi has obviously had a lot of success too.

ftltyk,CuteFaithlessness6,Sports,Tablighi Jamaat & Covid,"It was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.","Yeah, I see people on social media platforms asking for them to be shot at, and all. It's pretty unfortunate and I'm afraid that all this hatred will translate into violence, just like it did in Delhi recently. ",/r/india/comments/ftltyk/tablighi_jamaat_covid/

*Tips:*

1. Believe only the verified information from reliable source.
2. Be careful and alert in public, keep an eye out for sick, coughing peoples nearby.
3. Keep distance from people. Can be friends or colleagues.
4. Careful buying food, groceries etc. don't touch foods if you don't have to.
5. Wash hands [properly](https://www.who.int/gpsc/media/how_to_handwash_lge.gif).
6. Avoid Handshakes, Use verbal greetings instead.
7. Cough within [elbow angle](https://images.megapixl.com/1783/17830764.jpg).
8. Don't touch anything if you don't have to e.g. Bus, Train, vehicle poles and door handles.
9. Carry Hand sanitizer if you can.
10. Apply the sanitizer on area you touch like ATM, bus poles or other public used things you need to touch. ( little awkwardness in public is better than getting sick )
11. Non-essential gathering in large groups must be avoided. e.g. sport events, concerts, meetups etc.
12. Get more information from [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019) or other verified research institute.
13. suggest..

*Thoughts:*

Personally called few numbers to correct the map address. Found out in gMap they had different names. So please check the map links and make sure you're going to right address. Before calling them do your research. ""Get  info"" calls can make a line busy and  real people in need suffers.

When calling few centers myself, a person received my call asking if they are the govt assigned center to test corona, he got scared at first just by hearing the name. Which made me wonder how less information he might have about the pandemic. I hope you get all the right information about this threat. Wash hands as much you should, definitely more. And please be kind to others, if you feel sick of corona symptoms please do not take it lightly. Get help, ask for help. Do use mask, self hygiene, self quarantine and don't spread. You might spread it to your family and friends first (the closest we get ) so most of all don't be a dick. We can fight this by fighting the urge to get close to people washing hands.

e7s7rg,spacejesus01,Sports,We are not perfect,"19(m) just an average boy in college with a messed up life..so the other day i overheard my parent's conversation about me where basically my dad went on to rant about how i have basically achieved nothing in life while kids my age(having no financial support)have done wonders. And I've come to realize how Indian society mocks and pressurize teenagers to be at the top while completely ignoring the fact that not everyone has to be perfect and there is no shame in admitting that we are full of flaws and I'm hope people come up with things they want to say about themselves not being perfect 

Here I'll start

""I'm  19  i cant even ride a bicycle and I'm afraid to drive and i literally do not like any kind of sports""

Edit : this post is not about me complaining or whining about my parents...neither is it about seeking redressal for being a failure in life(becauselets be honest we'veheard that crap a ton of times)...Its more about accepting the way you are because here in India every judge's you ..from you looks to your talents to your abilities....its okay not to be special because a large portion of people are above you...sometimes being bad at something everyone expects you to bd good at or something that everyone is good at and your not is Okay !!","The comparisons to other people of your age is normal and everyone has faced this in their life. Note that, I am saying everyone has faced this doesn't mean that it is right and in the contrary, it is detrimental on the mindset of how we are brought up. The fact is that after our parents do this comparison, some people don't give a damn after a certain age but some people still end up comapring themselves with their peers. 

Yep, nobody is perfect but we have to do something meaningful in the world to earn our living, etc. How do you want to earn your living and lead your life should be up to you and you alone, IMHO.

Now, it looks like the muscles near my shin area keeps on hurting after I run or put pressure on my legs(by jumping or running). It's been around a year and I don't think this injury is going to heal itself now. I've been to different doctors but no one knew shit. Gave me useless medicines, xrays and even a fucking MRI that cost me a fortune. I'm hopeless at this point and don't know what to do.

fn5zmp,HumanWhoLikesDogs,Sports,How should I feel?,"How should I feel that I'm privileged? I'm 25, earning 60k, and it's not that I'm dumb or something but sometimes I feel how to feel. My dad's a government officer, mid-fifties, earns more than a lac. He's the most hard working and disciplined person I have ever seen. He's in the government since his early twenties. He's just 3 years away from retirement. He loves reading and love making contacts. My mom's a housewife(mid-forties or late forties, lol I don't know her date of birth), she's sweet, lovely, caring and love making people happy. My sibling is the best. He's earning okay. My parents have raised me well. I'm glad I grew up in the nineties, so I developed a lot of interest in sports and played a lot of them at competitive levels. I had a profound interest in video games and computers. My dad bought a one in the early 2000s I guess, with Windows 95 on it. He used it for typing, there was something FoxPro thing I don't exactly remember he used to do. Then most of my 2000s went playing with friends, games, school, etc. It was real fun, to be honest. I cherish those memories, a lot. College was not so good, but okay kinda. I realized a hell lot in college, not the studies haha but a lot about me. I'm not on Facebook and Instagram, quit them already. In the past year, I've developed a rigorous thinking about work and how not to throw away your life. It's really turning good for me. I follow Angel co-founder Naval and like him a lot. He's a good man. All in all, I have my interests or niche that I follow. It's good to not be mainstream sometimes. I don't have a goal. The only thing I know is to work hard, improve my skills and learn continuously. I joke at people who settle down and say learning stops when you get old. I call bullshit. 

But I don't know how should I feel? Being in a country with people who are deprived of such things. Should I feel guilty or thankful? I would think, if I was born in a poor family, I would've been living a mediocre life, with struggling to survive. I think when I reach 30, I will be financially independent. Only dependencies I want are my parents and sibling. No external sources like marriage or some other shit.  They raised me right, now it will be my turn to be with them at old age. 

Thanks for reading.","No one. If my mind still works at 60 and health, I don't think I'll have a problem spending time. I'm just going to grind myself as much as I can, work hard as much as I can, build relationships along the way. Everything's get compounded. That's the rule of life. If you follow it, you'll just be fine. Worst case scenario would be to find someone who's interested to not have children, be rational, and not boring.

The history of Akharas makes it look like India really is into wrestling. So much that often time whenever a normal indian fights you can see him using a crude style of wrestling.

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

### 1)¬†SARS-¬≠CoV-¬≠2¬†

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer¬≠reviewed, open¬≠access journal ‚ÄòEmerging Microbes and Infections‚Äô has cautioned that SARS¬≠-CoV-¬≠2, the virus causing the COVID-¬≠19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-¬≠2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What‚Äôs more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID¬≠19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ¬≠fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ¬≠ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ¬≠ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‚Äòsevere condition‚Äô. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019¬≠nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force‚Äôs fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* Rejuvenated Ghats, along the river, would improve the people -river connect and would also become places that reflect local culture and history.
* The project will significantly improve the visual aesthetics of the area. For Ganga Rejuvenation, improvement in aesthetics is also an important aspect.
* River water quality improvement through a reduction in the disposal of untreated sewage, solid waste disposal, etc.
* Increase in Tourism which will create opportunities for local employment.
* Prevent the disposal of un-burnt / partially burnt bodies in the river and reduce the pollution due to the cremation process (IWC save 200 kg of wood per cremation and 1 tree per 3 cremations).

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists.

dindz9,kash_if,Sports,"TIL: Record for highest attendance during a sporting event in India was during 1997 Federation Cup Semi Final between East Bengal & Mohan Bagan that witnessed an audience of 131,781 at Salt Lake Stadium, Kolkata.","Most of you probably know that they are bitter rivals. East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

etpkb0,hojackthewhoresman,Sports,"17 y/o girl, wants to be a chef, parents stereotyping. [advice]"," 

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",Love the username btw. ,/r/india/comments/etpkb0/17_yo_girl_wants_to_be_a_chef_parents/

fm9kmq,mohitkr05,Sports,COVID-19 - Information,"&#x200B;

These are the collection of data from various resources.

# Corona virus - What it is?

Novel - First time human immunity system is being exposed to this virus

Corona virus - Family of viruses with crown shape

**Symptoms**

Please **monitor your temperature if you have dry cough**. If you get high temperature & any of the mentioned symptoms in point 2, please seek medical advise. In a case, if you have sore throat , please practice social distancing and isolate yourself.

The ‚Äúincubation period‚Äù means the time between catching the virus and  beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the  incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly  around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become  available.

The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are

1. **fever, tiredness, and dry  cough** (The AND is important point to note\*\*)\*\*.
2. Some patients may have **aches and pains**, **nasal congestion**, **runny  nose**, **sore throat** or **diarrhea (Apart from mentioned above)**.
3. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.
4. Some people become infected but don‚Äôt develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
5. **Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease  without needing special treatment**.
6. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
7. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop  serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing  should seek medical attention.

**Spreading**

People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose  or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.  These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other  people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then  touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if  they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or  exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter  (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.

**Asymptomatic Spreading**

&#x200B;

1. If a person is asymptomatic, it is highly that he is not communicating the disease till he follows a good personal hygiene.

The main way the disease spreads is **through respiratory droplets**  expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from  someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with  COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the  early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19  from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel  ill.¬† WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of  COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.¬†

# How to protect yourself

You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:

&#x200B;

1. **WASH your hands** : Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
2. Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from  their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you  can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person  coughing has the disease.
3. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why?  Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated,  hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,  the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
4. Make sure  you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This  means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when  you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why?  Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you  protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and  COVID-19.
5. Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever,  cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in  advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why?  National and local authorities will have the most up to date information  on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your  health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.  This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other  infections.
6. Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19  hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading  widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places ¬†‚Äì especially if you are  an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.
7. Self - isolation period should be 5-14 days.[Guidelines for Home Quarantine](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Guidelinesforhomequarantine.pdf)
8. Please call ahead if you are visiting a doctor.

**Please make sure if you use mask , you know how to handle it. Incorrect handling and using of mask will lead you in troubles (touching front of the mask, not disposing it , touching mask again and again to adjust it)**

Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially  coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable  face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after  someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide  shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks¬† ([see Advice on the use of masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)).

The  most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are  to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow  or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from  people who are coughing or sneezing. See  [basic protective measures against the new coronavirus](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks) for more information.

Guidelines for home qurantine

## Recommendations for travelers

It is prudent  for travelers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas,  in particular for elderly travelers and people with chronic diseases or  underlying health conditions.

General recommendations for  personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one  meter from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for  all travelers. These include:

* Perform hand hygiene  frequently, particularly after contact with respiratory secretions. Hand  hygiene includes either cleaning hands with soap and water or with an  alcohol-based hand rub. Alcohol-based hand rubs are preferred if hands  are not visibly soiled; wash hands with soap and water when they are  visibly soiled;
* Cover your nose and mouth with a flexed elbow or  paper tissue when coughing or sneezing and disposing immediately of the  tissue and performing hand hygiene;
* Refrain from touching mouth and nose;
* A  medical mask is not required if exhibiting no symptoms, as there is no  evidence that wearing a mask ‚Äì of any type ‚Äì protects non-sick persons.  However, in some cultures, masks may be commonly worn. If masks are to  be worn, it is critical to follow best practices on how to wear, remove  and dispose of them and on hand hygiene after removal (see¬†[Advice on the use of masks](https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1269003/retrieve))

As for any travel, travelers are also advised to follow proper food hygiene practices, including¬†[the five keys for food safety](https://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/consumer/en/5keys_en.pdf?ua=1&ua=1), as well as¬†[recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to human in live markets](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

IMO, if this cannot be backed up with numbers and is just your or somebody's qualitative interpretation, it's better to remove it. The danger is that our whatsapp-level people will interpret ""very low"" as ""no risk"" and say measures like self-quarantine and abundance of caution are unnecessary because risk is low.

He‚Äôs told me that in India, it‚Äôs rude to refuse food, and that hosts will often push you to eat more than you might otherwise need/want.

The problem is that I am recovering from an eating disorder and it‚Äôs really important for me that I listen to my fullness cues otherwise I‚Äôm super prone to relapse. 

It‚Äôs also troubling because many members of his family are overweight and I am really nervous at the thought of visiting them and being pressured to eat more than I am comfortable with.

I want to enjoy my time and also not feel pressured to overeat, while not coming across as rude.

How can I politely refuse food if I am full? Is it really as impossible to do so politely as my boyfriend has made it seem? Thanks!",">mentioned that you loved it.

Engineering is the social engineering by RSS via BJP, with Modi its leader for now. Modi will go but what about RSS. Even BJP can go, but what about RSS?

RSS predates India. It understands the Hindu psyche. It had to in order to execute its hatred for Muslims.

It is scary but so true that Hindus resonate with RSS ideology. In particular they share RSS hatred for Muslims.

From now on, there are TWO Indias, constantly at war with one another. This war will never end. It is Maha Bharat all over again.

Muslims have no choice but to fight back. That is the only way for them going forward. They have to fight back on so many dimensions. Not just the conventional sword and arrow. But the psyche, technology, education, business control, industry dominance, economic prowess, etc. 

Muslims are just too many to keep behaving like sitting ducks as they have behaved in the past RSS instigations. They have a history, precedents, in-built means to act spontaneously. But they have no means for collective organization, uniform goals, and effective united actions. If Muslims can overcome these three defects, they can cow down any Modi, any BJP, and any RSS.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.

An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

[Image from the incident](http://imgur.com/a/a4JA2Qb)

The man in the blue shirt and the red circle was the one who gave the speech, the man in the brown shirt and the blue circle was the man who supported him. The other man in white confronted him and counselled him for his words. I could add a voice record that I recorded out of fear and anticipation that something of this sort would happen.

TL;DR : Muslim man was told to leave the flag hoisting event by a person for not cheering ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" infront of  association members and children from the colony. Association apologizes and condemns his words.",Always nice to see someone open to acknowledging a point. Good day to you. ,/r/india/comments/eu36ic/my_fears_about_how_the_current_political/

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

ewi9qq,Budget-Independent,Politics,[Politics] How would India have looked like if it was Subash Chandra Bose who took over as first Prime Minister?,"**https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/155944/7/07_chapter%204.pdf**

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‚ÄòIndian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> ‚ÄúWhen I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant‚Äù

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.","> I don't think Hinduism was in any danger even during that period.

It does not matter what you think, what matters is what was and the Hindu-Muslim riots were rampant in British Raj, which I do not know if you've noticed, has split the nation in 2 (now 3).

fwo8b6,impstuff,Politics,[P] How to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?,"My dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism. He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",Fucking ninja ,/r/india/comments/e1yy9u/did_sharad_pawar_ncp_congress_and_shiv_sena_just/

And then, this Tabliki Jamat incident came out and entire narrative shifted from 'everyone against corona virus to 'Indians against muslims spreading corona virus.

News channels are running shows day and night how Tabliki jamat members spread virus to remotest places in India.

This is going to have long term effects. Amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, Twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco.

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

bdfid1,FrustratedOCIHopeful,AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.","Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.","

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool).

Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them?

ai7392,fenocs,AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?","So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",I don't think our country will be in a position to live without these crutches for a long time ,/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/
avt1qx,PoiHolloi2020,AskIndia,Recommendations for books on Indian history written by Indians?,"Hello r/India.

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

For the history of British colonialism in India I've started with Shashi Tharoor's *Inglorious Empire*, but of course there's a lot more to India's genesis than British imperialism.

968di3,PsychoPass1,AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ","yes, some cases are too far gone to mend. some families are split, in one i know, the mother talks to the son, but not the father. grandkids [one boy, one girl]  fixed this problem in this case, but there are others where no compromise seems visible in the near future.

6bacbg,root_su,AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ","ITS LIVE. reply to awkwardmods comment with ""flaired"". He will check if you have added a flair or not and then It will delete his own comment AND your reply. ",/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here: 

https://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.

to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week.

66u52j,ringtring,AskIndia,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica ‚Äî all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",Aren't there any barriers set for Chinese imports ? China is dumping goods around the world. It's not a LDC. I guess undervalued currency also helps for exports.  ,/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/
4fyjjl,r_india_mod,AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

7zckca,Bikihuigormint,AskIndia,Well articulated anti congress Whatsapp forward. Bhakton ki nayi [p]eshkash,"


Received on the family whatsapp group

""A brilliant answer by Bala Senthil Kumar to the question below, as answered at popular Q&A site Quora.

 What is your view on the saying ""Congress has looted India for 70 years?""

It isn't the looting of wealth that bothers me so much as the sheer fact that the Congress merely replaced the Brits in some ways - they just became masters of the same, broken, weak people, who were simply willing to suck up to authority. Nobody gave India confidence! This is the part that bothers me so much, especially with MK Gandhi's style of 'winning' us freedom by giving the enemy higher moral ground.

So, India has grown up as an apologetic impotent nation, where our children are taught to revere impractical, passive, cowardly notions like non-violence, when everything in nature tells us to fight to survive. Of course I know the philosophy of not fighting because of being strong. But this comes from mastery, not shamelessly bowing to masters!

So, we saw a change of guard. The Brits went, and new masters came in the form of the Congress Party. Hierarchies remained, the class system remained, and subservience remained. Where the heck did all the dynamism go?

Then we were thrown into a socialist mindset, people waiting for alms from government wealth redistribution programs instead of being empowered. We got protectionist policies, that prevented prosperity and competition, throwing us away from a path of a meritocracy. Hindustan Motors was started around the same time as Toyota, and Tata Steel started around the same time as Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel produces around five times as much as Tata Steel without native resources of ore. No need to talk about Hindustan Motors and Toyota. Japan coming out of twin nuclear strikes was devastated way more than India under the Brits. Do we need to compare how different the growth paths of these two nations have been?

Only when thousands died did we start the Green Revolution. Only when China attacked us did we realize we need to become militarily stronger. Only with our backs against the wall, did India liberalize its economy. Under the Congress, every move we have made towards any kind of development has come under inevitable circumstances, with our backs against the wall.

India was never allowed to be truly independent, strong, and proud of its people's full potential. No wonder so many of us left in droves and thrived in various countries elsewhere. This is the loot I would feel most wronged by - denying India its best talents and minds, because we didn't create the conditions for dignified development.

Incredibly, the immense sacrifices of our fighting heroes were also swept aside under this avalanche of worship for Gandhiji. Why? So that the Brits would feel good? The Congress party was reporting to British Intelligence for 5 years after we became an independent country, about Subhash Bose's family's movements. During a criminal probe of the Bofors scandal, the Congress External Affairs minister delivered a letter to a foreign body to deny evidence and cooperation to an Indian investigating agency. Years later, a whole bunch of Congress members and their cronies used the letterhead of the Indian Parliament to petition the USA to not issue a visa to Narendra Modi, the man who would become Prime Minister. 

The Congress has a clear obsession with white people and a need to constantly please them. When Hillary Clinton asked India to wean itself off Iranian oil, the Congress government promptly obliged, even though Iran and India have been close friends for a long time. No surprise then that pasta aunty from Italy is their supremo. Think she would have got the same respect if she had been a Nigerian black woman? I don't think so. That's how deeply ingrained the slave mentality is in the ranks of the Congress.

It is the loot of India's pride, dignity, dynamism and die hard spirit that bothers me much much more than the loot of wealth. This country produced enough wealth to support the British Empire for 200 years. It can easily produce much more to ensure prosperity, health and well being for its own people. This is an abundant, powerful country, that has been prevented from being a developed, forward thinking, awesome nation that could by now have been an example for the world.

If India has been a weak, apologetic nation for so long, it's precisely because of the Congress. Why do we have to put up with these weasels and the fools who are aligning with them? I could even tolerate a ruthless, despotic, dictatorial mindset. It is this slimy, backstabbing, self serving Lutyens mindset that really irks me. I would give anything to destroy this smugness, decimate it, and put it firmly behind us.

The economic loot is nothing compared to this, but we will bloody well make them pay for all of it.

3huilc,r_india_mod,AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs","#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking ‚Äúwhere are the people of X party or Y group now‚Äù adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki.

3de8cn,r_india_mod,AskIndia,[Modpost] New Flairs for /r/India and Improving Discussions on /r/India,"Hello folks!

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",">Remove low-effort political self-posts.

4qepvz,rajasthaniConfused,AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?","Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

3ecyjp,r_india_mod,AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

---

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

---

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.","Agree with this, flairs should promote broad categorisation, not specific for every topic under the sun. ",/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/
3eesdr,ownliner,AskIndia,Any complications in future jobs because of absconding from workplace?,"A friend of mine quit his previous company and joined another org. But unfortunately he did not like it a bit. In a month and a half he got another offer, which is better. So he is planning to abscond from his current workplace(as the notice period is 3 months) and join the other org as early as possible.

BUT, what he has done is, he hasn't told the new org that he has already joined another org and will be absconding from there. All the documents for background verification are of his previous org.

So, is there going to be any complications in the future after he joins this new org? He is worried because he has got one month salary and PF from the company he joined recently but has not disclosed the same while getting another offer. He has told them that he is not working currently and can join immediately!!

6jnnbm,microsoftholmes,AskIndia,[NP] Which Tax Return to file if I'm both salaried and making money from side-gig?,"Hi, throwaway account.

Need some help / advice from you guys.

I am a salaried software engineer in Bangalore, but I'm also getting offers for freelance stuff. I am mulling over a few of these.

One of them seems promising. Three dudes in US are asking me to help bootstrap their startup, and I think I'd take this one.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

I am worried about the tax return filing next year. Up until now, I have only filed ITR based on Form-16 from employer. Never had to worry about foreign payment for services provided.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

Thanks for the help.

[Note: I am not sure how to add ""AskIndia"" tag. Mods please help]","if the amount is not very significant related to your salary , say about 25% of your salary, you can file an ITR showing it as income from other sources, but ideally, you should file ITR 4.

3wcid0,running_flash,AskIndia,Bill Gates' thoughts on Climate change and India's Role in it.,"He thinks that asking India to switch to cleaner and costlier energy is unfair. The developed world should take the initiative, dramatically increase investment in Energy R&D and come up with cheaper alternatives that are sustainable for developing economies like ours. 
Here's the excerpt from his interview with The Atlantic. 
>..when you turn to India and say, ‚ÄúPlease cut your carbon emissions, and do it with energy that‚Äôs really expensive, subsidized energy,‚Äù that‚Äôs really putting them in a tough position, because energy for them means a kid can read at night, or having an air conditioner or a refrigerator, or being able to eat fresh foods, or get to your job, or buy fertilizer.

>I‚Äôm a big believer in foreign aid, but the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the U.S. and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they‚Äôll make it cheap enough for everyone else. But the big numbers are all in the developed economies, where China‚Äôs defined into that term.

> I want to call up India someday and say, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a source of energy that is cheaper than your coal plants, and by the way, from a global-pollution and local-pollution point of view, it‚Äôs also better.‚Äù

25ix5m,iKidA,AskIndia,The long and fascinating story of how Dadra and Nagar Haveli got integrated into India.,"India is a big, complicated country with a big, complicated history. This means that any reasonably efficient attempt at trying to make sense of Indian history must, unfortunately, gloss over the hundreds of thousands of little stories that went into making modern India. Take, for instance, the liberation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli.

> *""On the night of July 22, 1954, a group of nearly fifteen volunteers of the United Front of Goans (UFG) under the leadership of freedom fighters Francis Mascarenhas and Vaman Desai assembled outside the border to discuss the details of the assault. They marched across the border and approached Dadra, around midnight. When they neared the police station, they recognised sub-inspector Aniceto Rosario, their archenemy. He was responsible for the ill treatment of UFG members in the police custody at Daman and they sought revenge. At that time, he was addressing a group of 100 to 150 villagers; warning them against the illegal entry by outsiders through their fields. They were also told that disobeying the orders would be met with serious consequences. The volunteers managed to crawl into the village, while some of them mixed with the locals assembled at the meeting. The remaining went round and began to close in from behind the police station.""*

Much violence followed. More [here](http://www.navhindtimes.in/ilive/how-18th-june-road-got-its-name). And in this newspaper clipping [here](http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19540724&id=wXUjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sL4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=5673,3493515).

Two weeks later Nagar Haveli was also captured, and the liberators declared that the little enclave was now ""Free Dadra And Nagar Haveli"", an independent country, with no international recognition of course, but run by a pro-Indian government called the Varishtha Panchayat. Some time afterwards the Panchayat asked India for help to run the enclave. 
> *""In response to requests from the Varishta Panchayat and the Administrator of Nagar-Aveli, Dr. A. Furtado, who proposed to resign, the Government of India agreed to make available the services of a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Service as the Administrator of those areas. Shri K. G. Badlani took over as the new Administrator with effect from 17 October 1960. It is also proposed to elect a new Panchayat to replace the present Panchayat which consists of nominees. This new Panchayat would act as the Legislative Council of the liberated areas.""*

From this Ministry of External Affairs report [here](http://mealib.nic.in/?pdf2487?000). (PDF)

Meanwhile the Portuguese government took India to the International Court of Justice. The court passed a judgement that upheld the Portuguese claim that its sovereign territory had been over-run, but then curiously passed another judgement that prevented the Portuguese from actually doing anything about the Indian 'invasion'.  Copy of the judgement [here](http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/32/4521.pdf). (PDF)

Understandably, both countries insisted that the ruling went in their respective favour.

Thus for seven years, from 1954 to 1961, Free Dadra and Nagar Haveli existed in a state of political limbo, nicely helped along by the government of India and Mr. Badlani.

And then in 1961, after Portuguese India had fallen and been annexed by Indian forces, D&NH requested to be merged with India. The popular telling of what happened next is as follows: D&NH quickly created a legislature, that then elected IAS officer KG Badlani as Prime Minister of Dadra and Nagar Haveli for just one day. That same day he signed over the territory to the Republic of India. And this handover was formalized with the tenth amendment to the Indian Constitution. Amendment details [here](http://mail01.tinyletterapp.com/NowHereThis/now-here-this-6/1076673-164.100.47.134/intranet/cai/a.pdf?c=66b2a0b7-a1c6-4faa-8c15-2659fdd94b72). (PDF)

I've not been able to source any documents to suggest that Badlani was actually made a ""Prime Minister For A Day"". But there is little doubt that he was, if only briefly, the head of state of a tiny little quasi-independent enclave in India before it was gobbled up by the republic.

And thus, my email-friends, was a nation built.

fvatsr,tralfamadelorean31,AskIndia,[askindia] Are there any hikikomori in India? Are you one? Let's talk about this.,"Hello, 

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers?

fkql7h,2throwawaythrowaway,AskIndia,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.","Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.","Thank you for your reply covering all my questions.

> Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.

I think high risk would be 35+ age, woman suffering with thyroid problem/gestational diabetes and a few more problems. Right?

> 3 is average and is by no means overweight.

I knew it!

> Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women

Can a woman fight against this? Like, if one is on the labor bed, do Indian nurses/doctors tell to the lady/husband what medication they're giving?

> Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala

Yes, its in Kochi named Birth Village. I am looking at such options. All are away from where I currently live and we'll have to look for accommodation options too there.

5. In case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in a car, do lock all the windows and call the police.  In case of 2 wheeler, just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump, toll, shop.

en5o69,itonocis,AskIndia,[AskIndia] Hey /r/india Please help me with ideas for donating money. (Also CMV if my approach/thinking is wrong.),"Hi!

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

Looking to hear your views on how/what causes to donate to. Or share your thinking around this issue..

**Sebi finalises norms for listing of green bonds** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Regulator Sebi has finalised norms for issuance and listing of green bonds , which will help in raising funds from capital markets for investment in the renewable energy space.The rules have been finalised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) after taking into account inputs from the finance and environment ministries, as also from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE), a top official said.The final guidelines would be made public soon, he added.While Sebi had proposed a new framework for issuance and listing of green bonds more than a year ago, the final rules were hanging in balance as the regulator was awaiting response from various ministries and departments on proposed norms.The regulator has now received comments from the MNRE, while the inputs from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change were received earlier, the official added.A green bond is like any other debt instrument issued by an entity for raising funds from investors. However, what differentiates it from other bonds is that the proceeds are ear-marked for use towards financing green projects.As of now, there are no standard norms for green bonds.Sebi's board had considered and approval a proposal for issuance and listing of green bonds way back in January 2016 to help meet the huge financing requirements worth USD 2.5 trillion for climate change actions in India by 2030.Subsequently, the regulator had sent a copy of draft circular in this regard to the Ministry of Finance for inputs from the concerned government departments.Green bonds can be key to help meet an ambitious target India has of building 175 gigawatt of renewable energy capacity by 2022, which will require a massive estimated funding of $200 billion.The new norms would also help the investors take informed investment decisions and bring in uniformity in the disclosure requirements, Sebi had said after its board approved the proposal last year.Financing needs of renewable energy space in the country require new channels to be explored, which can also help in reducing the cost of the capital.Sebi had decided on the new norms after taking into account public comments to a draft paper issued by the regulator in this regard in December 2015.Issuance and listing of green bonds will be governed by the Sebi regulations for debt securities but the issuer of green bonds will have to make incremental disclosures.These norms would also provide for requirement of independent third party reviewer, certifier or validator for reviewing, certifying and validating the pre-issuance and post-issuance process, including project evaluation and selection criteria. However, this has been kept optional.The issuer will have to provide the details of systems and procedures to be employed for tracking the proceeds, the investments made and earmarked for eligible projects. The same would need to be verified by external auditors.According to Sebi, green bonds can help enhance an issuer's reputation and attract a wider investor base, while benefiting the issuers in terms of better pricing of their bonds compared to a regular bond.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

d931fb,howdy_rss,Business/Finance,"‚ÄúIndia is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.‚Äù","*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‚ÄòThumos‚Äô can probably be summed up by the saying ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhen making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‚ÄòIndian civilization‚Äô with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates‚Äô ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say ‚Äì ‚ÄúIndian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!‚Äù. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, ‚ÄúHow many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?‚Äù I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‚ÄòWesternization‚Äô. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‚Äòpreserving Indian culture‚Äô, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India‚Äôs supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. ‚ÄúThe easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization‚Äù. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman‚Äôs terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk‚Äôs radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India‚Äôs decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

fv9ifd,ringtring,Business/Finance,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ‚Çπ17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's why","Hi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ‚Çπ17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ‚Çπ17,000 crore, ‚Çπ11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new ‚Äúdisaster mitigation and response fund‚Äù üí∞ at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. üòé 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*‚Äù

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 üìù. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court üë®‚Äç‚öñ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (üôÑ) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court‚Äôs got no business in the executive üíº working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter üö´

Similarly, the approximately ‚Çπ6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union‚Äôs devolution under the XV-FC‚Äôs recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I‚Äôve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi‚Äôs SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society","1. Finance commission doesn't recommend on an event to event basis. It recommends on a bulk basis for the period of 5 years i.e. every 5 years and it had already recommended prior to this pandemic.

fxmvof,DheerajKochhar,Business/Finance,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,"  

***LOCK ‚Äì ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would‚Äôve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world‚Äôs population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today‚Äôs situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren‚Äôt performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, ‚ÄúOut of Adversity comes Opportunity‚Äù. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‚ÄòHome‚Äô is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector‚Äôs growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India‚Äôs GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector‚Äôs contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India‚Äôs GDP by 2025.

¬∑ **Real Estate ‚Äì Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India‚Äôs Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

¬∑ **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

¬∑ **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

¬∑ **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

¬∑ **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

¬∑ **Long Term ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Wealth Building Asset with ‚ÄúPredictable ‚Äú Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **‚ÄúPredictable‚Äù Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Capital Appreciation in long term**, don‚Äôt be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company‚Äôs stock price or your bank‚Äôs health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

¬∑ **‚ÄúHelps you Raise Money Quickly‚Äù** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

¬∑ **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **‚ÄúWine and Real Estate improve with Age‚Äù** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

¬∑ **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

¬∑ **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

¬∑ **Co-living market** size across India‚Äôs top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

¬∑ **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

¬∑ India‚Äôs improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why ‚Äì**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand ‚Äì Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it‚Äôs time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor‚Äôs portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual‚Äôs cash flow and wealth.

**‚ÄúBUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don‚Äôt WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

I'm going to try and sleep now. Thank you for reading this.","bro code. also slap some thalis while youre at it,OP.

fzsng3,Roastedchicken69,Business/Finance,Actuarial student looking for some career advice.,"Hey there internet people!

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?","Yep, You need to find useful points from it. No need to get the whole meaning out of this comment.

fiolca,decipherseattle,Business/Finance,Oil slump? India will rather play dumb by raising prices,"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/government-raises-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-by-rs-3-per-litre-2194742?pfrom=home-topstories

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

fzfkko,Nawin1993,Business/Finance,Lives & livelihoods in India,"Lives and livelihoods

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ‚Çπ1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now ‚Äî about ‚Çπ10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ‚Çπ3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ‚Çπ3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",The gov want to restart the economy. I have no issue with that. But to start this stage of the virus where cases have just started to come out that's risky. Instead of stopping it this measure may accelerate the spread. Imo wait a month. Start restarting d economy from next month. ,/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/

### 1)¬†SARS-¬≠CoV-¬≠2¬†

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer¬≠reviewed, open¬≠access journal ‚ÄòEmerging Microbes and Infections‚Äô has cautioned that SARS¬≠-CoV-¬≠2, the virus causing the COVID-¬≠19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-¬≠2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What‚Äôs more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID¬≠19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ¬≠fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ¬≠ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ¬≠ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‚Äòsevere condition‚Äô. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019¬≠nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.¬† In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.

   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force‚Äôs fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state‚Äôs foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.

Development of ghat includes the various components like Changing Room, Toilet with bio-digester and reed bed, IWC, water spout, chhatri, platform, signages, horticulture work, railing, solar light pole, etc. Construction of the ghat will be completed in 15 months.

#### Benefits:

* Rejuvenated Ghats, along the river, would improve the people -river connect and would also become places that reflect local culture and history.
* The project will significantly improve the visual aesthetics of the area. For Ganga Rejuvenation, improvement in aesthetics is also an important aspect.
* River water quality improvement through a reduction in the disposal of untreated sewage, solid waste disposal, etc.
* Increase in Tourism which will create opportunities for local employment.
* Prevent the disposal of un-burnt / partially burnt bodies in the river and reduce the pollution due to the cremation process (IWC save 200 kg of wood per cremation and 1 tree per 3 cremations).

fmob0d,UsualEducation,Business/Finance,What the fuck is modi doing ?,"What the fuck is modi doing ? He's unfit to be leader of this country. 

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt. Industrial activities will be delayed as demands will be greatly reduced due to depletion of people's cash reserves.",Ghanta bajaao ,/r/india/comments/fmob0d/what_the_fuck_is_modi_doing/
dnohi0,Oxeam3,Business/Finance,Diwali 2019: Mark My Word Thread (and link to previous predictions),"First of all **Happy Diwali Guys**. Keeping up /u/pollguard legacy and /r/India tradition. I present to you Mark My Word Thread of 2019.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Last years thread-https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9uxnic/diwali_2018_mark_my_word_thread_and_link_to/

dwnioc,Vibgyor_5,Business/Finance,Help! How do I stop my dad from squandering away his savings?,"**Background:**


My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO. 


**TL:DR** Dad burning money in an educational venture. How do I stop this?",cool ,/r/india/comments/dwnioc/help_how_do_i_stop_my_dad_from_squandering_away/
ee6xey,wricker,Business/Finance,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!","**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‚Äòus and them‚Äô. ‚ÄòWe‚Äô, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don‚Äôt even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant ‚ÄúJai Shree Ram‚Äù; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to ‚Äútermites‚Äù; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‚Äòsovereign socialist secular democratic republic‚Äô? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren‚Äôt ‚Äòsocialist‚Äô or ‚Äòsecular‚Äô anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. ‚ÄúUnity in diversity.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnited we stand, divided we fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndia is the world‚Äôs largest democracy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are a secular country.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndians are known for their hospitality.‚Äù

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don‚Äôt want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That‚Äôs absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ‚Äô19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ‚Äô19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‚Äògood‚Äô.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‚Äònation‚Äô. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about ‚Äúescalatory matrix‚Äù. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as ‚Äúbloodbath‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse flag operations‚Äù. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers ‚Äúretaliated effectively‚Äù.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji‚Äôs purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‚Äòrats‚Äô (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans‚Äô jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. ‚ÄúSee!‚Äù said the Nazis, ‚Äúwe told you they were cunning criminal rats!‚Äù

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and ‚Äúanti-nationals‚Äù and ‚Äúurban Naxals‚Äù were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y‚Äôknow, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.","Only the region around Kolkata was industrialized. North and east Bengal were not. Most Bengalis were poor. The people who became Brahmos were lower castes. The people who joined Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti were poor. Bengali nationalism was a phenomenon of the masses. The ""Bengali internationalists"" who were opposed to Bengali nationalism, like the Tagore family, were rich and influential.

Edit: it is true that Bengal was one of the richest and most industrialized regions, but to think that GDP and degree of industrialization translates to riches of the common people is a logical fallacy ",/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth.

d4mq0p,zaplinaki,Business/Finance,"The impact of GST on invoicing, and thus on revenue and profit of organizations operating in India - exploring one of the factors impacting the economy right now","tl;dr

Because of GST, organizations have to bill the clients in each state that is involved because of GST norms. If before GST this required one bill, it now means multiple bills depending on the number of states involved. It could go as high 36 bills (29 states + 7 union territories.) This means that if pre-GST X effort was required to make 100 rupees, it now requires n\*X effort (1 to 36) to make 100 rupees. Meaning that the work required to make the same amount of money has increased by 100% to 3500% 

This has impacted the profit of the companies and thus the economy. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before I begin, I am not an expert on taxation - I am a business guy working in B2B sales for an Indian MNC. My 3.5 year career has been largely post-GST, but I have experienced the pre-GST era as well. I constantly have to deal with GST and its numerous requirements.

My objective is to highlight a major roadblock that I and many other business folks have encountered due to GST, and I feel that this aspect is playing a big role in the slowdown and at the same time has been left largely unexplored till now because of the grassroot nature of the problem. The people higher up don't encounter this directly and anyone who doesn't encounter this wouldn't understand the gravity of the problem aka reporters, etc. Again to reiterate, I am not trying to debate the improvements over VAT and I am merely here to highlight a side of GST which is hindering my revenue and my profit, thus my business.

&#x200B;

Let's start with some basic concepts first:

/**1) Invoicing:** The act of giving a 'bill' for the products or services utilized by a customer. For most people, this is a simple receipt at the end of a meal for instance, or at the checkout counter of a clothing store for the clothes you've purchased, or a bill given by a cleaning service for cleaning their homes.

But for an organization, an invoice is the means to collect money from a client. Anything that is sold to a client will generate an invoice for the products delivered/services rendered. The invoice will also have the tax details (GST number, billing address, registered address, shipping address, list of items that need to be paid for, applicable tax - CGST, IGST, SGST, payment due date, and authorized signatures)

**An invoice is a means to collect cash from the client. Without a proper invoice, cash cannot be collected. This is where the problem starts. Since not having a 'proper invoice' gives a lot of ground to the client to delay the payment.**

&#x200B;

/**2) The process of Invoicing / Invoicing function in an organization:** Once the product is delivered or the services rendered, or sometimes before they are delivered, invoicing is triggered, meaning that a 'bill' is generated and the money has to be collected from the client. This is usually done through an ERP like SAP or Oracle. The invoice then reaches the collections department, where the collection manager submits the invoice to the client for verification and payment. **The collection managers are the front line people tasked with bringing money into the organization.** They are one of the most important people for running the business because their performance impacts the cash flow of the organization.

They are normally tagged to accounts, aka clients. One collection manager could be handling anywhere from one client to thousands, depending on the nature and size of their clients.

**Once the client verifies the invoice, the money is transferred to the selling organization and it becomes revenue and subsequently profit for them.**

**If the client holds the invoice for any reason, then it becomes lost revenue or a bad debt (loss) for the selling organization.** The longer the client holds this money, the lesser the value that money holds due to the concept of time-value of money. 100 rupees today is considered as more money than 100 rupees one month from now due to the time-value of money. Thus a delayed payment impacts the profitability of the organization.

**/3) GST for the services industry:** GST dictates that the invoicing for services will be done in the state where the services have been delivered. **I will explain this concept in detail as this is the crux of the problem.** To start off, I will outline a simple sale and how that sale would translate into the pre-GST and post-GST era:

**Problem Statement:** Assume that Tata Motors intend to buy 5000 chairs for their offices from Pepperfry for 50 lakh rupees. Tata Motors also wants Pepperfry to install the chairs in their offices (5 lakh rupees), and then provide 5 years warranty including a checkup every year to determine the life of the chair, and any repairs required (15 lakh rupees.) Tata Motors wants the chairs to be delivered to 50 offices in india, across 20 different states. This is a mix of products (chairs) & services (installation and maintenance.) The total bill is for 70 lakh rupees -

5000 Chairs - INR 50 Lakhs

Installation of Chairs in 50 Offices across 20 states - INR 5 Lakhs

Maintenance of Chairs for 5 years - INR 15 Lakhs

Pepperfry sales executives will take the purchase order from Tata Motors and put the order into their system. The input of the purcahse order will trigger three functions:

a) Delivery of the products & services

b) Invoicing and payment for the order

c) Post-Sale service & maintenance

**Pre-GST Invoicing:**

Before GST came into the picture, the above bill would be generated by Pepperfry as a single bill centrally ie they would generate a bill for 70 lakhs, with the extra relevant VAT and the tax details of the two organizations. This would be on **ONE SINGLE BILL** for the entire deal, irrespective of state, city, etc. They would just give Tata Motors one single piece of paper saying that they are owed 70 lakhs with the due date for the payment.

Manoj who is Pepperfrys collection manager for Tata Motors will submit this single invoice at the Tata Motors office where it will be checked by the Tata Motors procurement and finance teams, and if there is nothing wrong with the invoice, the payment will be cleared off by the due date.

**Again the point to focus on here is that only ONE INVOICE is needed for the delivery of the chairs and services to the entire country. Manoj has to submit just one invoice, follow up on invoice, and collect the payment on one invoice. Tata Motors teams have to verify one invoice, and process the payment on one invoice. Only one tax number and billing address is needed on the invoice because it is being done CENTRALLY.**

If there is something wrong with the invoice, Manoj has to correct only one invoice and resubmit it to Tata Motors.

&#x200B;

**Post-GST Invoicing:**

Like I mentioned before, GST dictates that the invoicing be done in the state where the services have been delivered ie separate GST filing for all states. Explaining further this means that a separate invoice has to be generated for each state that is involved in the transaction. If this one state involved, one invoice. If two states are involved, then two invoices. If five states are involved, then five invoices. And in this case since twenty states are involved, twenty invoices.

&#x200B;

The values of the invoices are split in direct proportion to the usage. If 100 rs is the total bill value, in three states, Maharashtra, UP & Kerala with 60:30:10 usage, then the bills will be:

Maharashtra - 60

UP - 30

Kerala - 10

So in a sense it is a separate company in each state in terms of GST.

**Moving on to the implication in the Tata Motors - Pepperfry transaction:**

Since the chairs have to be delivered in 20 states, Tata Motors & Pepperfry will have to have a registered office in all twenty states along with a GST number for each state. Tata Motors will have to issue 20 purchase orders in the proportionate value to Pepperfry ie 70 lakhs split proportionally into 20 states. The sales executive will enter twenty purchase orders into the system. Then deliveries will be triggered for 20 states and 20 different invoices will be handed over to Manoj after generation.

Manoj will submit 20 invoices to Pepperfry, whose procurement department will then verify 20 invoices, give it to finance to verify and then initiate 20 payments. Then 20 payments will be received by Tata Motors (with 20 banking transaction ID's) and Manoj will verify the 20 payments and close the transaction for now. ***This is the ideal scenario.***

As you might have been able to tell, the effort required by everyone involved in the deal has gone up 20 times. This effort required will be the same as before if there is only one state involved on the buying side, ie Maharastra selling to Maharashtra. It'll be twice the effort if two states are involved on the buying side, ie Maharashtra selling to UP & Kerala. **It has a possibility of going upto 36 time the effort required previously for the same amount of money since there are 29 states and 7 Union Territories. Yes Union Territories are treated separately as well.**

&#x200B;

**The impact from this is:**

**/1) Efficiency/Effort:** Pepperfry is still going to make 70 lakhs on the deal but the effort required will be twenty times that of before because Tata Motors will give 20 purchase orders on which 20 invoices will be generated. The time taken to process these invoices is the same because their value does not impact the time taken to collect the money on them. This is because each invoice will be the same template, its just that their  values will be different. Example:

Maharashtra

Chairs - INR 5 Lakhs

Installation - INR 50K

Support - INR 1.5 Lakhs

Kerala

Chairs - INR 3 Lakhs

Installation - INR 30K

Support - INR 90K

UP

Chairs - INR 10 Lakhs

Installation - INR 1 Lakh

Support - INR 3 Lakhs

The total money being collected is the same as before but the sales executive, Manoj, the procurement guy & the finance guy have to do 20 times the work for it with no other added value.

Their efficiency in this scenario has gone down to 5% but it can arguably go down to 2.7% if all states and union territories are involved, although this is a rare case.

Also like I said that this is the ideal scenario. It doesn't always go this smoothly. Some of the challenges encountered are:

a) Incorrect proportions of purchase orders / invoices: Someone made a mistake if 10 needed to be allocated to UP, then they've allocated 11 or 15. The process has to be repeated again after finding the fault.

b) Incorrect GST on PO / invoice: Suppose a particular invoice has the wrong GST, it means that it can't be processed on incorrect tax information, which means that that money can't be collected on that invoice. Before GST there would be one wrong tax number, now it could be one or two or twenty. Mistakes happen in the real life. This is one of the most common things we face. Mistakes happened before GST as well, now they just happen in multiples. And we really can't expect people to make mistakes because they always will. Again efficiency goes down as multiple times the effort is required to fix the mistakes.

c) Missing GST: It isn't necessary that all companies will have a GST registration in every state. So Tata Motors might not have a registered office in 2 states for example ie they won't have a GST number. They will now have to provide a declaration to Pepperfry saying that they don't have a GST number for two states, and then Pepperfry will be able to give them the invoice. The payment of the money is delayed till then. Getting that declaration in my experience takes a long time because if Tata Motors says that, they aren't able to claim input tax credit in that state. That's like leaving money on the table for them - and getting this declaration basically saying that they are willing to lose money on the transaction, requires approvals upto the highest levels because it is a loss to the company. Manoj now has to follow up on two more time consuming things to get the same amount of money and thus efficiency goes down further.

**/2) Cash Flow:** Cash is the lifeline of a company. A company without cash cannot survive. They could be valued at a billion dollars but if they don't have cash to pay their employees, they will shut down. Kingfisher couldn't pay their employees, interest, vendors because they didn't have cash left, same for Jet - again doesn't have cash for payment of salaries, fuel, loan payments, etc. BSNL again is struggling to pay for things because they don't have cash.

Thus a healthy cash flow is one of the most important aspects of the business or for the survival of the company. If companies were people, cash flow would be the oxygen. Invoicing is how cash is brought into the company.

Because of the decrease in efficiency of the collection managers, a delay is introduced in the collection of the cash. So if pre-GST cash was being collected in 25 days, now it would be taking say 45 days because the collection managers efficiency has gone down.

And the tiny delays add up. Incorrect GST - add another 7 days for that cash to be collected, missing GST - add 15 days, etc.

This has two outcomes:

Firstly, because Pepperfry had earlier predicted that they'll get the money in 30 days but they are now receiving it in 45 days, that means the 70 lakhs they need at the 30th day for their daily expenses now needs to be found from somewhere else since this 70 days will now be coming after another 2 weeks. They will have to dip into the reserves for 15 days.

Secondly, the money has lost some value. It was 70 lakhs at the end of 30 days but now since time has passed, it has lost some value due to the time value of money. It could've generated interest or it could've been invested but now this is delayed and hence some value is lost. This is a loss to Pepperfry.

To summarize, **GST has delayed the payment cycle of the company. It now takes longer to collect the same amount of money than it used to before GST was introduced. If money takes longer to come in, it takes longer to go out - salaries, interest payments, vendor payments, and other outflows are impacted.**

**/3 Profit:** The profit made on a deal varies from company to company and deal to deal. Let us assume that Pepperfry made 10% profit on this deal ie 7 lakhs. Due to the following factors this profit will get impacted:

a) The payment cycle is delayed so they're collecting the profit after a longer duration. They will have to collect 63 lakhs before they start making a profit. This could be after say they've collected 13 of the 20 invoices. The remaining 7 will give them their profit. So basically profit generation is delayed because the cash flow has been delayed. This means that the profit made on the deal has lost some value. If pre-GST this was 7 lakhs, now it'll be less than 7 lakhs in value due to the time value of money. And again because efficiency has gone down, the effort required to generate the same amount of profit has gone up, and thus the profit on the deal has actually gone down.

b) There are 20 invoices to process. Not all will always go through. Many will get stuck and the payment will be delayed or may never come due to the process issues. The money that will just linger there and never come to Pepperfry will become a bad debt to them. If the invoice gets stuck for some reason like incorrect GST, missing GST, incorrect value, the cash won't be collected for that invoice and that amount will get reduced from the profit. So because the invoice hasn't gotten processed, the 7 lakhs profit will now be less say 5 lakhs. If more than 7 lakhs is not collected on the deal, then Pepperfry will actually make a loss on the deal.

The biggest culprits of this are PSU's like HPCL, BPCL, UBI, etc. Their requirements are so stringent that if there is a single mistake and they hold the invoice. This payment could get delayed for years and thus the profit on the deal is impacted. They just won't pay till everything on the invoice is correct or they could delay for multiple other reasons. Many businesses don't sell to PSU's because of this reason - their profits and cash get stuck in doing business with them.

This is different from pre-GST because earlier if say there was a mistake, there was one invoice to fix. Now there could be many. For the same amount of revenue as before, now chances are you won't make the same amount of profit.

**Thus due to the lowered efficiency, longer payment cycle and stuck payments, the profit made has gotten impacted.**

&#x200B;

In conclusion to my ramblings, due to the state-specific nature of GST, the effort required to make the same amount of money as the pre-GST era has gone up. This has impacted the revenue and thus the profit made by companies and these are problems that everyone will face because of how GST is. If you want to do business in multiple states, you will have to be ready to face these challenges.

Feel free to discuss the impact this will have on our economy. In my opinion it has had a big impact but I really need someone much more knowledgeable than me to analyze and publish that. I feel this deserves a conversation at the very least because this one change has impacted revenue and profit extensively, it has made making money harder and thus is going to have a lasting impact on the economy. The worst part is it doesn't look like this system is going to change in the near future.

do5hj9,dropctuned,Business/Finance,Rant - What are we even doing here?,"What are we even doing here? For millennia, the uber rich have controlled the world. With access to better education, networking, medical, climate, resources, and technology, is it even fair for someone from a third world country or other developing nations to dream about achieving the kind of lifestyle that an average first world citizen takes for granted?

&#x200B;

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years. 

&#x200B;

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here? 

&#x200B;

Echo chambers are designed to consolidate like minded people into their own virtual spaces. With confirmation bias playing a significant role in hindering mental evolution, is it really a surprise that people are getting dumber by the day? For a society to be healthy and functional, different points of view must be at the very least - considered. But, when all you hear are cheers for your bigoted and backward views - it marks the end of higher thought. 

&#x200B;

The system is broken - and neither democracy nor socialism/communism is the answer. Dictatorship isn‚Äôt either. Just for clarity, violence and anger are not the answers either. The last 20 years have seen the kind of global change that our ancestors could never have imagined. Yet, our philosophies of governance have not evolved. Our constitutions are old, and our leaders are too far gone. We need to come up with new ways - starting from scratch - to govern ourselves if we want to take the next step to human evolution.",Good.

e8as8b,y0ujin,Business/Finance,Will India embrace blockchain?,"India has followed China in its wish to embrace the blockchain technology. The India Times reported on Nov. 27, 2019, that India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is set to embrace blockchain technology adopting a national strategy.

The minister of state for electronics and information technology Sanjay Dhotre said a few weeks ago:

>Considering the potential of Blockchain Technology and the need for shared infrastructure for different use cases, an approach paper on National Level Blockchain Framework is being prepared.\[...\] Blockchain Technology as one of the important research areas having application potential in different domains such as Governance, Banking and Finance, Cyber Security, and so on.

Besides, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has supported a blockchain project ""Distributed Centre of Excellence in Blockchain Technology."" Blockchain-based ""Proof of Existence (PoE)"" framework is being developed for different uses (authenticating academic certificates, sale deeds, and other documents) by the ministry. Dhotre added:

>By using the PoE framework, \[a\] solution is developed to authenticate academic certificates. Blockchain technology has also been used, and PoC \[proof-of-concept\] is developed for vehicle life cycle management and hotel registry management.

India is developing a property registration based on the blockchain, which is being piloted in Telangana state. Other blockchain use-cases are focused on cloud security, trade finance, and central KYC.

It is worth noting that India has been experimenting with blockchain since 2017. According to Deloitte's research conducted in April 2017, Indian players tried to implement blockchain in such spheres as trade finance, supply chain financing, e-KYC document management, cross-border payments, and others.

Though India seems to be ""pro-blockchain,"" it is still negative on crypto. On July 16, 2019, India proposed a draft bill banning trading and using cryptocurrencies. To separate cryptocurrency from digital rupee and digital foreign currencies (which are backed by Central banks), the government has given a definition of crypto in the draft bill:

>Any information or code or number or token not being part of any official digital currency, generated through cryptographic means or otherwise, providing a digital representation of value which is exchange with or without consideration, with the promise or representation of having inherent value in any business activity which may involve risk of loss or an expectation of profits or income, or functions as a store of value or a unit of account and includes its use in any financial transaction or investment, but not limited to, investment schemes.

Apart from that, the report has named several reasons to ban crypto and impose fines and penalties for conducting any activities connected with it in India.

1. Crypto is created by non-sovereigns and serves as a private enterprise in this sense.
2. Crypto has no underlying intrinsic value and lacks all the characteristics of a currency.
3. Crypto has no fixed nominal value, so it neither acts as a store of value nor as a medium of exchange.
4. Crypto is extremely volatile.
5. Crypto cannot serve the purpose of a currency as it is ""inconsistent with the essential functions of money/currency"", so it cannot replace fiat.

dlf5x8,spider143,Business/Finance,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office Theory","So when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop. He said , ***""No one is going out of the village even to sell. Last week 3 autos drivers had sold their autos and moved into other businesses.""***

**My personal inference**: A lot bad is going. The news channels are not showing anything. The ones that do show about this, are yet very far away from the ground realities. I am just wondering about farm labours who have no source of income except daily wage. The news channels and people bragging about Hindi-Muslim debate are either paid or brainwashed.

czff99,nosleepnomore,Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",Please cross post on r/Indian_academia if you don't get any replies here.

What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India‚Äôs biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent‚Äôs other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China‚Äôs brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar‚Äôs Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua‚Äôs controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia‚Äôs hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‚Äôs selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed‚Äôs justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‚Äòhumane authority,‚Äô a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China‚Äôs aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan‚Äôs analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world‚Äôs largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan‚Äôs theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: ‚ÄúSince the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.‚Äù

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

I am a third year engineering student with an interest in management (have past internship experience in finance as well.) I am a founder of an upcoming consulting club at my university where we intend to take on pro-bono projects for local NGOs and other management related activities. 

I am looking to have a short stint, say a month (4-6 weeks) at a consulting firm, learning the way things are done and managed in the consulting sector under someone's guidance would be more than enough for me and I am fine with it being unpaid as well. If someone can help me out with this in any manner then that would be great! Locations: Mumbai>Chennai>Bangalore

What is the status of the Waste Segregation and City Compost Policy under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which were supposed to be taken up in 2017?


Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why can‚Äôt the bureaucracy look at such solutions?


Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: ‚ÄúI am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act‚Äù. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire ‚Äî learning to unlearn yesterday‚Äôs wisdom.

You ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in Narmada dam. Why?
Today coastal Saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat, how can you afford seaplane?

Why petrol not included in the GST?


Why Alcohol not included in the GST?


How this government understand the final effect/result of any project they rollout.(e.g Jan Dhan/ Ganga /Demonetization / etc)

Why is only 3% of the budget being concentrated on the education? Why haven't you shared the cess collected in the development of the schools? 


Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF‚Äôs Rs. 28k and RA‚Äôs Rs. 35k-40k

Experts in the field of solid waste management know that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan can become the biggest employer, and solve several issues. But state govts and municipalities continue their nexus with contractors who charge astronomical sums for waste-handling equipment and for transportation of waste.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.



HEALTH CARE



Why does the government not take inspiration from NHS scheme in the UK (which provides efficient and great healthcare to UK residents)?

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? 

&#x200B;

do i need a manufacturers licence ?","Current Account opening can be done if you have a GST registration, HDFC can do it.   ",/r/india/comments/9t7uyw/serious_help_i_invented_something/
ahuc0c,nosleepnomore,Business/Finance,Please help me with career advice,"I am a 24 year old male with BBA in Finance. I studied in Thailand. My family lives in Thailand. We have a diamond trading business. I worked with my dad for a year before finding a job in a jewelry factory. I have been working in this factory for little over a year now.

I am being paid 55k baht a month. The problem is, there isn't much growth in this industry. I feel the industry is shrinking. I am hoping to get out by this year. Another problem is, it is very difficult to get a job as a foreigner in Thailand. 

What skills can I develop on the side so I can switch industries? I am thinking programming. But I have no prior knowledge. I do not mind coming back to India for work.

Is MBA a good option? What other ways can I make money on the side?

I have around 10 lac rupees saved.",Can't completely disagree with you there.  ,/r/india/comments/ahuc0c/please_help_me_with_career_advice/
al2pdh,ablahnaari,Business/Finance,Broke up 30! What next???,"Hi Everyone,

I browse through reddit quite a bit and love the answers and support that comes especially under relationships/life.So here goes my story.

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

besg9q,nosleepnomore,Business/Finance,Is it possible to switch careers at 24? Please help.,"I started working in a loose diamonds family business at 22. Worked only for a year and switched to a jewelry factory because it was difficult to work with my dad. 

I am 24 and still at the jewelry factory. The timings are tough - 9 am to 7 pm Mon-Fri. 9 am to 3 pm on Saturdays. I get paid only 55k. But most importantly, this is a dead end job. There is a stagnation in learning and earning after a few years. My manager with an experience of 18 years earns only 130k a month.

I am planning to self-teach web development. I do not come from a technical background. I did my undergrad in BBA in Finance. 

Is it possible to switch careers at this age? Is it possible to get jobs in Singapore, Hong Kong or other countries as a self-taught web developer?

Another option is to keep doing this job while freelance as a web developer. Is this possible?",PhD at 30? Are you already in your PhD or going to start on it soon? Still I would say it‚Äôs brave. ,/r/india/comments/besg9q/is_it_possible_to_switch_careers_at_24_please_help/

9pj0at,random_throwaway1579,Business/Finance,"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed? [Long]","Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",That's ok but how much of a strain is it? Is it manual work as well? What can you do in between customers? How many hours of actual work so you have to do in a day?  ,/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/

9ypjsr,DexterMilburn,Business/Finance,"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.","# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

I've always seen my friends and colleagues use Google to find businesses (especially with geolocation), and Urbanclap for booking services. Apart from that there are the standard food delivery and ticket booking apps like Swiggy and PayTm.

Yes, it's a pain to use multiple apps, something JD is promising to solve. But I've never seen anyone use JD regularly. Yes, I've also logged in once, maybe a few years ago and found it severely lacking in comparison to google, and left it.

Next comes the part about Financing. I think that JD is charging businesses to list themselves, but why would anyone pay? The app has a very small user base I recon.

79u1il,pure_haze,Business/Finance,The Kerala Model,"Let's have an objective discussion of the merits & sustainability of the Kerala model. Please don't downvote if you merely disagree. 



1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries. 





3. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foeign jobs, the state‚Äôs unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.  [Source](http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/not-rank-state-wants-kerala-high-unemployment-we-need-more-entrepreneurs-govt-says-61216)

[Source](https://medium.com/@thousifmohammed/why-kerala-rank-last-in-ease-of-doing-business-7da7ed96d113) 


5. Consequently, abysmal FDI inflows, at just over US$1.2billion in 2000-15 (the last 15 years), just 0.5% of total inflows. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka received over US$17billion and US$16billion respectively in the same period. [Source](http://indien.ahk.de/fileadmin/ahk_indien/Bilder/2015_News_and_Info/economic_news/collab_-fdi_into_india.pdf)




6. High Debt/GSDP of 29.7% (2015 Budget Estimate) compared to an India-average of 21.2%. Though that's an estimate, the 2014 Revised Estimate was 31% and 2013 actual one was 31.6%. I would take the estimate with a grain of sand. [Source](http://niti.gov.in/content/debt-total-outstanding-liabilities-percenatge-gsdp) This is also with them having a monopoly over the liquor industry through BEVCO, and one of the highest per-capita consumption levels of alcohol by state.

2. And finally, **the extreme dependence on remittances:** Remittances finance as many as 20% Kerala households, or 2.4 million families. Assuming a family size of three, remittances directly affect 7.2 million of 35 million Keralites, according to a recent paper in the Economic and Political Weekly by K C Zachariah and S Irudaya Rajan based on the Kerala Migration Survey, 2014. [Source](http://www.firstpost.com/india/gulf-remittances-to-kerala-drop-to-four-year-low-due-to-declining-oil-prices-2738866.html)



* Remittances, at Rs 70,000 crore, accounted for 36.3% of the net state domestic product (NSDP) in 2014.



* Remittances constitute a fourth ‚Äî Rs 22,689 of Rs 86,180 ‚Äî of the per capita income of Kerala in 2014.



* Remittances were 1.2 times the revenue generated by the Kerala government in 2014.

I like this summary: **‚ÄúRemittances from global capitalism are carrying the whole Kerala economy,‚Äù** said S.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.","

I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

86kq7c,Tam-Brahm,Business/Finance,"Law graduates of r/India, My close friend (cancer survivor), plans to do LLB this year. He is 36 years old. Is there any merit to his decision ?","Hi,

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

I am the ""friend"" mentioned in the original post.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.","Actually that‚Äôs pretty much perfect. Patents and Trademarks within Intellectual Property Law are two fields that require a degree in science/engineering. (Except for when you want to pursue them only as an attorney)

Well, all in all, I don‚Äôt see any missing pieces left in this endeavour. :) I heartily wish him well.

IP is a field that‚Äôs always embedding with newer developments. And yes, IIT-KGP is a good choice. He might want to consider IP related research and internships while he is in the program. I strongly recommend attending conferences and writing research papers.  ",/r/india/comments/86kq7c/law_graduates_of_rindia_my_close_friend_cancer/
azoh6g,Avinash_Sharma,Business/Finance,"Suddenly, ‚Äòone nation, one policy‚Äô sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman","You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission‚Äôs (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States‚Äô models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the ‚Äúone nation, one policy‚Äù sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You‚Äôve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure ‚Äì both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn‚Äôt States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC‚Ä¶ and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‚Äònow that the States are flush with funds‚Ä¶‚Äô, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States ‚Äì we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level ‚Äì 49%.

Aren‚Äôt untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit‚Ä¶

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can‚Äôt ‚Äòuncommit‚Äô. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana‚Äôs contribution to the CSS was around ‚Çπ2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ‚Çπ3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS ‚Äì the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF ‚Äì backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS ‚Äì money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre‚Äôs allocations. I don‚Äôt think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same ‚Äì that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census‚Äô population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What‚Äôs your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference ‚Äì for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government‚Äôs priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so ‚Äì we are hoping that will be there.

What‚Äôs your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don‚Äôt get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn‚Äôt GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It‚Äôs only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum ‚Äî both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre‚Äôs version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won‚Äôt any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn‚Äôt the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can‚Äôt anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‚Äòinnovations‚Äô that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That‚Äôs how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate ‚Äì State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India‚Äôs environment cause?

>No. But it‚Äôs an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple ‚Äì forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost ‚Äì it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

6s4hoh,rahultheinvader,Business/Finance,TL;DR ‚Äì Godman to Tycoon ‚Äì The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,"Context ‚Äì Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It‚Äôs published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author‚Äôs perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author ‚Äì Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna ‚Äì Ramdev‚Äôs deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father‚Äôs frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** ‚Äì a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can‚Äôt keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don‚Äôt earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal ‚Äì ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn‚Äôt have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev‚Äôs interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‚Äòtesticles of some sort of wildcat‚Äô. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries‚Äô Ayurvedic unit ‚Äì AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn‚Äôt budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev‚Äôs Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying ‚ÄúI have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving‚Äù. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn‚Äôt cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party ‚Äì **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha ‚Äì When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha‚Äôs owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev‚Äôs political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev‚Äôs brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit‚Äôs face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‚ÄòSome people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma‚Äô. Soon Ramdev‚Äôs men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev‚Äôs biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO ‚Äì **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev‚Äôs business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra‚Äôs influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee ‚Äì **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste ‚Äì Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn‚Äôt normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali‚Äôs market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section ‚Äì [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as ‚Äúthe Hindu rate of growth.‚Äù Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2¬†The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4¬†Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. ‚ÄúCollective learning‚Äù is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals‚Äîall these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds‚Äîit created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8¬†During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9¬†India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and ‚Äúmines of gold.‚Äù He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12¬†What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13¬†It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,‚Äù14¬†and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a ‚Äúper capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.‚Äù15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, ‚ÄúIn India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.‚Äù16¬†There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and ‚Äúdeindustrialized‚Äù India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule ‚Äúde-industrialised‚Äù India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant‚Äîby 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a ‚Äúdrain of wealth‚Äù, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment‚Äîthe so called ‚Äúhome charges‚Äù‚Äîwas in fact quite small.20¬†If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.‚Äù¬†22¬†The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence‚Äîand after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24¬†If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25¬†An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital‚Äîall of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26¬†But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not ‚Äúexploit‚Äù India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27¬†Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses‚Äîhence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace‚Äîthe Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution‚Äîan agricultural surplus‚Äîbut the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

‚Äú1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.‚Äù31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32¬†It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These ‚ÄúBangalores‚Äù have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù in world trade between 1950 and 1970; ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism‚Äîor rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These ‚Äúmillion negotiations of democracy‚Äù slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its ‚Äúlow level equilibrium‚Äù of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35¬†David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the ‚Äúotherworldly values of the Hindus‚Äù or the ‚Äúimmobilizing effects of the caste system‚Äù and the ‚Äúconservative habits of the merchant caste‚Äù. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that ‚Äúpeople would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.‚Äù37¬†It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs‚Äîit has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (‚Äúremove English from primary schools‚Äù). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


","1) I have a major issue in asking the descendents of colonial British to atone for the sins of their ancestors. We don't ask for the Iranians or the Afghans or the Marathas to apologise for the acts of their ancestors (Nadir Shah, Abdali et al)  which were as brutal as anything the British conjured. responsibility. (or at least we shouldn't)

2)Two centuries of colonial rule has to be seen in the context and morality of its time. Conquest of territory by force was completely acceptable until the 20th century. Indeed that is how all Indian empires were built.The assumption that any other native monarchy would be gentler than the British is extremely naive. 

3) let us not assume we don't whitewash history of our national heroes. Ashoka is seen as a great king (which he was) despite Kalinga and the various massacres mentioned in the Ashoka vadana. So is Akbar (siege of Chittor). Any time we call out the British, it is rank hypocrisy ",/r/india/comments/6zeuk0/i_find_rindia_circlejerking_too_much_over_shashi/

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between ‚Äúteachers shouldn‚Äôt have to sell their own blood to make rent‚Äù & ‚Äúbillionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn‚Äôt exist in the same society‚Äù](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)","You missed my point and unfortunately not slightly. I am talking about the ultra rich here only. They earn SO MUCH MORE than others and it is well earned, no doubt but that also means that they should be, which they are, able to pay more in taxes. This is AOC's entire argument and she's not talking about the entire income, she's marginalising that over 10 million I guess. We can do that here as well, say, purely for example, any income above 300 crore can be taxed aggressively, 70% or 50% is not the point. This will increase tax revenue significantly without actually causing discomfort to middle class and actually help schemes like UBI or MIG, ergo helping the weakest.

P Chidambaram at the event in Rajkot on Saturday. (Express Photo by Chirag Chotaliya) P Chidambaram at the event in Rajkot on Saturday. (Express Photo by Chirag Chotaliya)

FORMER FINANCE minister P Chidambaram on Saturday lashed out Modi government, saying demonetisation and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have destroyed the country‚Äôs economy, forcing small and medium business to shut down. Interacting with businessmen in Rajkot, the senior Congress leader said demonetisation was not a bold step, but a reckless one. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a bold step? A farmer who commits suicide is also taking a bold step. Do you welcome it? Committing suicide also requires courage. I call it rash, reckless and adventurous step. You call it bold and beautiful. But the point is it has destroyed lives. For nearly two to three months, millions of people stood and waited in queues to exchange their (currency) notes. Nearly,140 people lost their lives. Carpenters, rickshaw pullers, plumbers who depend on daily earning in cash went without business for two months. Demonetisation was a foolish step,‚Äù Chidambaram said at an event named Samvad, which was organised by a local Gujarati newspaper.

Chidambaram also took a dig at the government, saying the note ban has failed to achieve all its stated objectives like putting an end to black money, curbing terror funding etc. ‚ÄúThere is nothing like black money but merely income which is taxed and income which is taxable but escapes tax net. There is a shadow economy (in India) but there is shadow economy in every other country. India‚Äôs shadow economy that is transactions that don‚Äôt come under tax net is around 12 per cent. But that‚Äôs average for Europe also. There are many European countries which have shadow economy of more than 12 per cent. Even America has around eight per cent shadow economy. What is shadow economy? It is income that your tax system is not able to capture. The answer to shadow economy is to make your tax system more efficient. If you put cruel rates of tax, people will avoid it. People will say why should I pay‚Ä¶ If you make friendly tax system, they will pay. The answer is not demonetisation. It‚Äôs like saying there is a mosquito in my house, I am going to burn my whole house,‚Äù he said.

He added that the introduction of GST in its present form has destroyed small and medium business as requirement for online filing three returns online per month had forced them had forced them to shut down. He said these businesses were job-creators. ‚ÄúIf you invest Rs1 crore in big business it won‚Äôt create jobs. But small and medium businesses which create jobs are struggling for survival. Therefore, they are not hiring and no jobs are created,‚Äù he added.

Chidambaram also claimed that the demonetisation and the roll-out of GST had dealt a severe blow to the economy, sending it into a downward spiral. However, he said, the government maintains that the economy is in fine fettle. ‚ÄúDay before yesterday, the Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) said the Indian economy is on strong micro economic fundamentals. And the finance secretary said it was growing at 7.5 per cent, between 2014 and 2017. Why are they announcing Rs 5 lakh crore Bharatmala? Why are you announcing bank recapitalisation all of a sudden. In your heart, you know things are not good. In the last six quarters, the growth rate has gone down from 9.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent. This means a drop of 3.4 per cent,‚Äù said the Congress.

The former finance minister opined that it was possible to overcome the situation by ‚Äútaking right steps and not taking wrong steps‚Äù. He said that he has faith that there are people in the country who can take right steps. ‚ÄúThe growth rate must not go down below 5.6 per cent. India doesn‚Äôt deserve growth rate below 5.7 per cent, and it is possible to take it up by taking right steps and not taking wrong steps. But for that to happen, the government must acknowledge that they committed a mistake by demonetisation and GST. There are people in this country who can do this. Government must hire from outside to correct the mistakes. Those in government can‚Äôt do it as they are the ones who have committed the mistakes,‚Äù Chidambaram added.

He claimed that 1,326 farmers committed suicide in Gujarat over the last four years. ‚ÄúThere are no jobs today. Jobs will be created only if small and medium businesses grow. To help them grow, small businesses should not require to register. Medium businesses must register but they should be given right to self-certification,‚Äù said the Congress leader. He said the government was talking about vikas (development). ‚ÄúPeople talk about growth. Growth is necessary. But what is the use of rojgar-mukta vikas (development sans job creations)‚Äù he asked.

The Congress leader also accused the NDA government of misplaced priorities. ‚ÄúThey will invest Rs1 lakh crore on bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad. How many people will travel in it. Around 300 or 400? Can‚Äôt we give Rs1 crore to each school so that new buildings are built, toilets are built, teachers are hired. Our priority is education, health, employment,‚Äù he said.

7yvec1,anonyfried,Business/Finance,[RANT] SBI worker blames me for faulty transactions even though plenty of their customers are getting scammed,"I received a message today about being credited with some 12k on my SBI account which confused me. Checked my online SBI account and realised that a week back some Google Octro had made a transaction of that 12k from my account which I had not realised. A simple google search showed that a lot of SBI customers were also complaining about this Google Octro thing (also found a TOI article on it). Its an App on the Google Play store from what I understood. But never mind that, I was just thankful I got my money back. However, a quick advice from my father was to close my SBI account because the Octro company may still have my account details and such, so there might be a risk of such fraudulent or faulty or whatever transactions to occur again. I've never taken the time to manage my finances or understand how fraud transactions work so this part is probably my fault because I realised a week late that 12k was even missing from my account in the first place. So I went to the bank to close my account and maybe create a new account after that.

Now I am not confrontational, and I even see my faults in the whole thing. But the man behind the desk was a whole different story. When I went and old him I'd like to close my account, he looked up the statement of my transactions. And I pointed out the faulty ones and he started blaming me for those.

He used a shitty ass analogy and I quote ""if a pick pocket steals from a person and the person doesn't realise then the blame lies on the person for not realising."" Yea right the pickpocket is the angel here for stealing from a man carrying a wallet. What the fuck is this victim blaming nonsense?? 

He told me I can't blame the bank for not realising I lost money. Except I didn't even blame the bank. I only told him I wanted to close my account and gave him the reason when he asked why??

And then I told him I have been busy with things plus my card was with my parents too during that time so I didn't properly check my account frequently and I realise that its my fault. And then he was like ""of course its your fault. Computer won't make mistakes it'll only do what its told, so if there was a mistake in telling it what to do then you should've realised and complained."" 

And then the icing on the cake was that he went on ""You youngsters are on the phone the whole day doing WhatsApp yet you didn't check the transaction message. I know you people are always looking at your phone and message toh aaya hi hoga. Tumhi ne nahi dekha."" All this after I explained that I know it was my fault that I didn't realise.

Why are office workers in India so rude? This may seem like a small thing for many of you but I hate confrontation and avoid it as much as possible. I even admitted the blame on my part and I didn't even lodge a complaint or anything but they still decide to aggressively blame and mock me for being irresponsible? lol and SBI is definitely not at all at fault even though plenty of their customers had actually suffered cause of this Google Octro fiasco.

My experience with SBI so far had been pretty decent until this incident. But now I'm just going to go ahead and get my account closed and move to another bank.

tl:dr SBI account had fraudulent transaction, got blamed for being irresponsible","> I was thinking of moving to ICICI. Anything should I know?

I wont touch ICICI with a 10 ft pole. They have kept my account frozen over a year now, for accepting a PayTM IMPS, while the PayTM account was allegedly funded by card fraud. Under which law it is responsibility of the receiver to verify whether sender earned money legally or illegally? ",/r/india/comments/7yvec1/rant_sbi_worker_blames_me_for_faulty_transactions/
6bacbg,root_su,Business/Finance,We really need to talk about Flairs.,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ","ITS LIVE. reply to awkwardmods comment with ""flaired"". He will check if you have added a flair or not and then It will delete his own comment AND your reply. ",/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/

**Deutsche Bank bets on India; zeroes in on bad-loan cleanup to generate outsized¬†returns** 

 ______ 
Deutsche Bank had 15.2 billion euros (.7 billion) of credit risk exposure in
India as of December, making up about 16 percent of its total across Asia-
Pacific markets, according to its 2017 annual report. (Reuters)

Deutsche Bank AG, which is in the throes of a global restructuring involving
thousands of job cuts, is zeroing in on an Asian market where an unprecedented
bad-loan clean-up offers the potential for a credit bonanza.

In India, where bankruptcy law changes have injected urgency into efforts to
restructure $210 billion of stressed assets, Deutsche Bank sees an opportunity
to generate outsized returns by refinancing and trading debt, according to
Amit Khattar, Asia-Pacific co-head of global credit trading. Khattar is
considering adding to his team.

‚ÄúFor India, this is where we think the greatest alpha lies for our credit and
financing businesses in the region,‚Äù Singapore-based Khattar said in an
interview. ‚ÄúWe want to get involved in most of the major deals out there. The
bank has no constraint in terms of scaling up in this area if there‚Äôs an
opportunity to grow the business.‚Äù

Speculators are flocking to India, lured by what the nation‚Äôs richest banker
has called a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù opportunity to sift through the wreckage of
its bad-loan debacle. Deutsche Bank is already a force there: much of its
Asian credit exposure is in India, and the nation accounts for the second-
biggest share of regional profits.

The bank plans to team up with other firms to arrange financing for Indian
debtors, Khattar said. It‚Äôs looking for partners to offer debtor-in-possession
funding ‚Äî which can keep a business operating during bankruptcy proceedings ‚Äî
as well as for structuring equity and debt financing for companies before they
slip into difficulty.

Khattar manages more than 100 people in his Asia-Pacific team, which provides
working capital to companies and trades debt on secondary markets. Headcount
has been stable in the past four years, and any addition isn‚Äôt expected to be
massive, he added.

He shares the team responsibility with Tokyo-based Beaux Pontak and both of
them report to global head of credit trading Chetankumar Shah in Singapore,
the bank said.

Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank is cutting at least 7,000 jobs as new Chief
Executive Officer Christian Sewing seeks to end three straight years of
losses. The firm dismissed four traders in the U.S. who focused on debt
markets, and Chris Lahoud, the head of the distressed team, is leaving, people
with knowledge of the matter said last week. In Asia, it‚Äôs trimming some
equity sales and derivatives coverage, Bloomberg reported last month.

**India Exposure**

Deutsche Bank had 15.2 billion euros ($17.7 billion) of credit risk exposure
in India as of December, making up about 16 percent of its total across Asia-
Pacific markets, according to its 2017 annual report. That included lending
commitments and traded bonds and debt. By comparison, Japan accounted for 17.3
billion euros while China and Hong Kong made up 16.5 billion euros.

This year alone, Indian lenders are racing to rehabilitate more than 4
trillion rupees ($58 billion) of troubled loans, as the Insolvency and
Bankruptcy Code in 2016 and banking rules force defaulters to pay up or
restructure. From Canadian pension funds to Asian investment banks, more
capital has flowed into lending, rescue financing and trading of distressed
securities.

Recent debt restructuring cases in India have involved some of the nation‚Äôs
biggest companies, including Reliance Communications Ltd., Essar Steel Ltd.
and Bhushan Steel Ltd. Many of the biggest bankruptcy cases are running behind
schedule, however, hit by issues ranging from a shortage of judges to legal
challenges. There are more than 2,500 bankruptcy cases wending their way
through 10 insolvency courts in India‚Äôs notoriously slow legal system.

Global private equity firms, special-situation investors, distressed-debt
traders and banks are converging on India, including Apollo Capital Management
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The likes of Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Varde
Partners Inc. are prowling for more.

‚ÄúThe bankruptcy code is a significant development which would generate
considerable opportunities in debt resolution,‚Äù Khattar said. ‚ÄúCompany owners
also want to retain their business and see long-standing debt issues resolved.
All these need structuring and capital.‚Äù

9zgjc8,bikbar1,Business/Finance,India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.
",Power is concentrated into the hands of the selected few in the states and these guys tend to live in the capital city or a few bigger cities. As a result the focus of development usually pointed around these areas. The far away areas remain neglected for decades. Even the state media often ignore the regional events. As a result when a grave crime against an individual takes place in a remote corner it only gets slight mention but the same event in the capital makes big headlines. That's why devolution of power is required especially in a chaotic country like India. ,/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/

At the same time, we can not hide stories about people promoting community spread of a deadly virus by whatever means like licking food, licking currency notes, hiding in mosques, temples, churches or gathering for religious functions. These acts harm more people through a virus which does not have a half life. I understand this particular fruit vendor was mentally unstable but that is not always the case. 

Unless I am mistaken there have been dozens of verified instances of foreigners hiding in mosques being caught by the police. These stories need to be brought to the forefront because they are a genuine public health concern, just like stories about a fruit vendor licking the produce or some guy licking currency notes. Naming and shaming is the only way to (a) raise public awareness (b) deter people from doing such things again. Even if someone is hiding in a mosque or a temple or a church, it needs to be brought to public attention. These news stories, despite sounding bigoted, play a major role in making people aware about the community spread of Covid-19. 

We can afford to blame our government, our institutions, our authorities. What we can not afford at this time is exponential community spread. We can not have many die because of the foolishness of a few. If people see any person or group of people repeatedly and intentionally doing things that increase community spread and put everyone‚Äôs lives in danger, there is bound to be massive backlash.

People need to be given really good education; not just being literate. And taught values like tolerance and harmony with difference.

This has always been the Indian way. Ironically, the idea of Hindutva and a Hindu Rashtra is more european than it is Indian.

However, that sentiment exists because of the suppression of the public hindu identity over millenia. Asian societies, generally are far more communal than individualist. Group identity matters and things aren't easily forgotten. So, when ""secular"" people say, ""oh that happened ages ago, forget about it"", it doesn't resonate at all with the Hindu layperson. Kejriwal was being bashed on this sub because he went to a Hanuman temple before the Delhi election result, this kind of bullshit pushes people towards the other side.

A lot of this history of persecution is also ignored and suppressed. Why do you think the Hindutva movement has legs? Over the rule of the Sultanate and the Mughal Empire a lot of temples were desecrated and Hindus persecuted, not much of the popular secular history talks about those things, so extremists fill in the gaps with their own narrative.

Independence was, for a lot of Hindus, finally a chance to correct historical wrongs and revive the public Hindu identity, especially in the wake of partition. However, the Indian state, in its quest for secularism, ignored much of those sentiments while providing concessions to minorities, such as the inclusion of different civil laws. These people think that the Indian state failed them on those fronts. 

I think it is ignorant to associate the Hindu identity and Hinduism with the the Sangh or any other extremist elements and it is a mistake for the secular wing of this country to paint anything saffron in a negative light. ",/r/india/comments/fphvyv/rss_gets_ready_to_fight_coronavirus_with/

As taken from Wikipedia. The whole point of the US war mongering was to achieve this dominant position in the world stage. That is also why the US is not being charged for war crimes. The Soviet Union was regarded as the other world superpower but after its disintegration the US remained the sole super power. Not that I personally prefer the US but it was just to give an abstract idea of what could be achieved had the policies and mindset been different in India. The Europe can be taken as a development standard but then again Europe is a continent, a cluster of nations. If one on the big ones fall the whole system collapses. In my opinion the fastest development wonder performed is by China. It used to be on par with India until a few decades ago it underwent massive change.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Australian Immigration is notorious for its policies targeted to keep the International students stuck in Universities so they don't get their PR and keep paying fees. Few years back, people used to call it Department of Goal post moving. lol.

But the way the government is discriminating once again with its temporary visa holders in this time of crisis, It breaks my heart for the people who will be struggling in the days to come , Its not a joke to survive in these countries with their high cost of living.

Whether one should stay there to see this through, It depends on one's individual situation, if you have that much money and time invested, going back will not be an option. Speaking from a point of safety Australia will be much safer and health facilities will be much better if worse comes to worse.

International students wont have the issue with healthcare because their insurance is prepaid for the duration of their visa so they have a safety net there.

As far as i have heard, the Australian government will give some relaxations which will apply to temporary residents as well. For example reducing tax rate for this financial year so that people get a chunk of their tax back as a refund, apart from that people who have savings in Super (retirement fund) will be able to dig in into a portion to get by.

fpc6tw,olivawDaneel,Food,"Drinking hot water, avoiding cold foods - prep for the virus","This is a question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority. Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",No I didn't doubt your experience.

Imagine, this was going to be the year in which we were going to put ideas like autonomous cars, flying cars, space tourism, asteroid mining, hyper-looping etc in action. Now, we are rushing to the grocery stores and fighting over trivial things like paper to wipe our backs. 

There is a quote in the movie Interstellar:

*‚ÄùWe‚Äôve always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that.
Or perhaps we‚Äôve just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we‚Äôve barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us‚Äù*

It almost feels like that our systems, our unity, our spirit, our patience and our human sensitivities are all getting tested at the same time. The Hope that there is another tomorrow keeps us all moving and fighting. 

It however goes without saying the C-scare has truly shown the fragility of our existence. We need to pause. We need to think what is truly important. We need to focus. It is time to rethink. We have not found another worlds. We have not found a way to escape yet.

fsagi8,dennkiesauros,Food,A long read but definitely provides much food for thought! Would like to know your thoughts on this.,"A comprehensive summary and analysis by Jaideep Varma. 

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",Hoping for the best. Only time can tell tho. ,/r/india/comments/fsagi8/a_long_read_but_definitely_provides_much_food_for/

918ek7,kasam_se,Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ","This is a good idea. I will definitely take this advice and find ways to help the family financially. However, the info I really need is regarding the universities/colleges and part time degrees that he can pursue at this point in time.

NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is

>

> ‚Äî Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time.

While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses ‚Äî in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

cj7xx0,gajanand_edu,Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, ‚ÄúStart-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.‚Äù The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India‚Äôs AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

&#x200B;

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion‚Äôs share in India‚Äôs market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year. 

One simple computer vision app can replace this entire job function (when I was working there, there were around 10 others who were doing the same thing, with different components) ",/r/india/comments/cj7xx0/what_is_the_future_of_artificial_intelligence_and/
bpgagr,arkoprovo1996,Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it ‚Äî we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

In case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals ‚Äî a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:‚Äî

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).
* Creating a network of sustainable [water](http://www.freewat.eu/) cycles to provide potable, [fresh water commons](http://openwaterfoundation.org/).
* Providing universal healthcare as a commons, producing [Open Source medicines](http://www.opensourcepharma.net/) & [medical equipment](https://hackaday.com/2018/01/30/making-the-case-for-open-source-medical-devices/), in our mesh of [bio-hackerspaces](https://biohack.me/), [while also](http://openbci.com/) [extending our human bodies](https://openprosthetics.org/)' capabilities through transhumanist practices and sustaining a thriving grinding (biohacking) culture in the city.
* Hacking our prodigal buildings to make them [more comfortable, effective & efficient](https://www.openbuildinginstitute.org/), connecting everything with DiY Open Source IoT systems.
* Nurturing a thriving pro-science, DiY, hacker/maker culture in our city along with aiding education in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Mathematics) and the humanities in their advanced forms ... the list goes on.
* And finally, scaling to the suburbs and villages of West Bengal, and even other cities in other states, connecting Kolkata to the global commons movement, and making ourselves visible on the global map, to help liberate the world.",,/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/
7yz12m,officialshebu,Science/Technology,Need help with depression and anger.,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.
....

Will add if you guys advice something worth it.","you got it spot on. I would start with #1 and #2 and rest will follow. Trust me pick a sport support a team, Start running, hiking what ever the fuck, but keep yourself active. Positive thoughts will come to you and you will be a much better human being.  

I personally feel running makes me stronger. you might find something else which motivates you but try to find what that is. ",/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/
4gbzmf,hganjoo,Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results","Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the ‚Äúeasy path‚Äù, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India‚Äôs comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let‚Äôs crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master‚Äôs programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student‚Äôs learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

28fy7b,nerds_revenge,Science/Technology,An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?","Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 ¬∞C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

friwew,manofsteel911,Science/Technology,One of the good effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot.,"One of the positive effects of lockdown is that air quality has improved a lot and pollution is going down.

It should be noted that worldwide more people die due to air pollution than what the covid19 has claimed till date.

While we have been very serious about tackling the virus threat we have literally done nothing to tackle the air pollution threat which claims more lives.

Let us all support reduction of pollution be it air,water or soil.

Edit : I am using technology to put my thoughts out to everyone. I am not anti science or anti technology nor development, rather my point is currently whatever we are doing has been causing more harm than good. So let us strive to make more informed choices in future be more wise , make sure we try to change tracks for cleaner technology.

f161mw,Snoopyrun,Science/Technology,[Serious Post] Bye,"It's about time for me. I don't see the relevance of trying to go through the drudgery again and again. I beg for some patience on your part to go through this post.

At 30 years of age with no set path for a career, I am utterly useless. I can't even provide for myself, let alone take care of others.

I am a 30-year-old, so-called general category lower-class family, man. Haha, how pathetic, isn't it.

&#x200B;

I was a good student till Xth, and then the slow downhill started in my scores. Struggling to pass 12th in state medium with 70% with just pass 50% in mathematics.

&#x200B;

Then, coming from a lower-class family, there were not enough choices for me to go through - either Medical or ENgineering. I prepared for Medical taking a 1-year gap. Nothing substantial came out of it. In the end, I had to go to engineering. Because sadly, in our country, gap years are a strict no-no for any of the stakeholders and I could not waste 1 more year.

&#x200B;

Did [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) in engineering in Applied Electronics & Instrumentation from one of the 'good' private colleges in Bhubneswar, Odisha. Yes, here in Odisha - so you might have guessed my economic conditions. Passed with Average CGPA of 7.1.

&#x200B;

No jobs came in the engineering field. At last, I was recruited by the service company (name starts with I) and had to go \\ for it.  This was 6 years back.

Why?

Because there was no alternate way for me. I am now the sole bread-earner of the family. My dad has retired from his job.

Trained in Mysore - I was not from a programming background. I found it really hard to go through the training especially the advanced chapters. I had to take a retest for the final exam since I failed in the first one. In the retest, I literally had to take the help of some kind souls who took pity on me and shared their answers. I passed with a retest with minimum pass marks.

GOt posted to Mangalore. Here, literally at the opposite side of India from where I cam from - I felt alone. Loneliness became my best friend. I avoided getting into any projects there -  be it support or development. Because I knew in my heart that I could not do it.

After a gap of almost 1 year there, I was forced by some managers into a support project. In this team, seeing my utterly bad skills, they put into a 1st level support person - a triage one - someone who acts as the first point of contact for customers, records their issues, creates incidents, tickets and passes onto other teammates. Literally this for 1 year.

Then, slowly they put me into an application support where SQL work along with a niche technology called TM1.

Being absolutely weak in any other technologies, let alone niche technologies - i could not really improve upon my situation.   Thus, they kept me in a bare minimum work state in this one too. because frankly I could not doa anything else.

I remained in this project for 4.5 years, then took a transfer to Bhubaneswar. Here, I avoided again, getting into projects for 1 year or more and then was again forcibly put into a support project where Informatica, Unix, TM1, Cognos is being used. I am in this one, at present.

HEre as well, seeing my lack of skills, I was put into a bare minimum level. My lead has literally scolded me so many times that I have become numb.

Below are not excuses or points to validate my inactions - they are just plain naked truths.

NOw after all this, you and hell, I would have asked myself -

what I am doing about it?

What I am doing to learn new skills?

What am I doing to even get into another job?

The answer is nothing. NOthing.  Why?

because I am listless.

I lack the memory right now to retain anything at all. I keep forgetting common things or points let aline study and become proficient in a programming language.

I lack the logical reasoning a person has to learn to actually code.

I lack the mathematical skills.

Now would you believe me if I told you I had scored 100/100 in my Xth Computer Science exam - consisting of OOPS, and Blue Java.

But now, I know what utter waste was that - not worth 2 paise in India and in this hyper-competitive world.

&#x200B;

Since these 6 years now, I have remained severely depressed with OCD patterns coming in as well. My memory has faded. My enthusiasm is gone for anything. Nihilism in my mind. I have tried to come out of it - I am not saying this lightly. I have tried to take away my mind on dwelling on these things and escape through any of the multiple options for a person to get some enjoyment - songs, podcasts, movies, etc.. But nothing works. I, after doing any of this, feel an existential dread as to what I have done in my life to deserve this moment of just happiness says while going to a movie or hearing to some podcasts. Guilt-tripping at its finest.

Sometimes in the middle of a day, I see something or think of something and I break down. Tears and only tears even on a bright day. At night, tears are my only friend.

You might think, where are my friends or family who can help me. The answer is I really do not have any such friends whom you can call at 2 am and speak your sorrow and get a shoulder to cry on.

My family, well - they had high hopes for me. My dad and mum had put everything to get me a good education and now I am in such a state. They are slowly coming to the conclusion that I am an utter failure.

My lifeline has been shredded by my inactions, my lack of skills, lack of intent to improve my situation. And now, too much time has passed. And I honestly don't see any point in it.

Sometimes I wish in my loved one's mind, I cease to exist - their memory of mine being faded in an instant - so that they do not have to go through the pain which they would feel when I take away my life.

What a sorry, pathetic, selfish piece of shit stain am I? You are thinking this, aren't you? Yes, I am that. I am all of them and much more.

But there is literally no way to go on any further for me. I do not see any career paths for me, I am not good at anything, I lack memory, I lack any interest in any field to be proficient in.

All doors are shut for me now.

Today while walking down the road, I suddenly wished what would happen if I just walk right into a front of any ofo the trucks which are passing by.

At least people would be spared seeing such an utter wastrel of a being which I have become to fall down further.

Thus, I have prepared everything to end it swiftly - I have put nominations with my mother's name on it for the 1 account I had. I have everything which they would need in one email - which is just waiting in my drafts to be sent.

I have written my goodbyes to them and prayed to them - they please forget they ever had a son. To erase my memories. I am written my farewell to my loved ones.

Now, thank you, dear readers, for going through this post. You have empathy and I pray for it to grow in your heart.

Bye.","If you read this, send me a DM. Let's talk. These feelings are not exclusive to you, many people have them. You need help and support, not an ""end"". I hope you get better. ",/r/india/comments/f161mw/serious_post_bye/
fywlyr,drgnfly61,Science/Technology,People who test negative might also have coronavirus: Study,">scientists have warned about a growing concern: the tests are not 100 percent reliable, meaning people with negative results might actually have coronavirus.
-------------

>The majority of tests around the world use a technology called PCR, which detects pieces of the coronavirus in mucus samples.
-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

fygqpd,Intepat_ip,Science/Technology,Latest Indian Innovations and Funding Opportunities to Combat COVID-19,"The untapped potential of Indian youngsters is coming to light through various funding opportunities and contests organized by the Government of India. Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,‚Äù the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.‚Äù

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam‚Äôs Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user‚Äôs location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation ‚Äì India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology ‚Äì India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, ‚Äú*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.‚Äù

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

Apar Gupta, Executive Director","1/ ""By the way, is the ability to comment on articles being considered for the upcoming revamped website? Perhaps this would fall under ""feedback and co-ownership"" mentioned here.""

Yes. We will add it to our discourse forum. 

2/ ""Along with the publish dates of articles, it'd be good to see the author's name somewhere as well to be able to compare their views over time in different pieces. It's not exactly clear from the positions listed on the About page who the editor is.""

All, articles have author data but is not displayed on the webpage. This should become easier and searchable with the website revamp. 

3/ ""All are unsubstantiated claims presented as facts.""

A. Incorrect assertion. We would urge you to read the submission present in the link which contains footnote references. You have not taken time to research publicly available materials or even those cited by us. Despite limited time for staff we are answering some queries as our effort is to engage not evade. 

B. ""How was it concluded that porn regulations in India come from ""British era laws"" or ""Victorian sensibilities"""" - The Indian Penal Code is the principal regulation from which these laws flow in India. You read up generally on the law of obscenity and its origins from legal books. These include three  commentaries we have referred in the past (Ratna Kapur titled, ""Erotic Desire"", Gautam Bhatia and Abhinav Chandrachud's books on free expression).

C. You can look at the factual data of the use of Section 67 from a study from Bhishakha Dutta from Point of View. Includes review of law and media reports. This underlying study is linked in our recent submission to the Ad-Hoc Committee on Porn. Again, please read our links and reference. 

4/ A lot of your other questions are personal views which are put as inquiries. To answer them with patience will take a tremendous amount of time as there is underlying information that is publicly available that you are failing to engage with (as in even our submissions). Such views are predominantly voiced by many people and you are fully entitled to disagree with us and call us out. But at certain points you have also mischaracterised some of our statements (""Why admit porn outside the scope of IFF and still push for it""). 

5/ We encourage such debate and are hopeful the information above is of help. We clearly believe that personal choices of adults with respect to pornography should not be criminalised. Given the recent report by the ad-hoc committee (as per media reports) stating that it would like to break end-to-end encryption these battles are for digital rights. We will keep fighting them effectively. Protecting free expression online is IFF's mandate. This is our work.

d0ffgv,freddledgruntbugly,Science/Technology,Chandrayaan Moon Landing,"ISRO's Chandrayaan 2 mission is a significant technological event that has kept space watchers in India and across the world riveted. The mission to land an Indian lander and rover on the moon's surface was launched on 22nd July, 2019. 

Chandrayaan carries two modules designed to work independently, Vikram, the lander, and Pragyan, the lunar rover. 

The landing module, comprising the lander and rover, has separated from the orbiter and will begin its descent on to lunar terrain shortly post midnight.

**Edit I: (7th September)**


Communications with the landing module were lost while it was around 2.1km from the surface. 

Failures in space exploration are disappointing and expensive - but are inevitable (and one could argue essential for eventual success.) 

To space enthusiasts; keep the chins up - the orbiter lives - and will hopefully fulfill its mission objectives in full. 

**Edit II: (8th September)**

The Chandrayaan orbiter has found the exact location of the lander on the lunar surface. 

ISRO confirms that a thermal image of the lander has been taken. The Chandrayaan 2 team will investigate the reasons for the loss of communication with the lander using signal data.

There is no information on the state or condition of the lander yet.

5jscfe,Glorious_Comrade,Science/Technology,A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

I would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this. ","I wanted to consider a reddit-specific community, so that people can maintain the basic anonymity if they so choose. ",/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/
e6ekhy,thruaway593,Science/Technology,India needs to invest more in education and health care or else the future of India is doomed.,"Why doesn't the govt invest more in education? 

Education funding is only 3% of GDP, while many developed nations spend about 6% of GDP. Many experts say education funding should be ideally 6% of GDP.

Look at the age demographics of this country. According to 2011 census data about 608 million (60.8 crore) are below the age of 25, about half the population of the country and about 372 million(37.2 crore) are below the age of 15, so about 30% of the population is below the age of 15, as India's was 1.21 billion (121 crore). Today, we would have even a larger total no. of people below the age of 25 and 15.

It is also said the India's demographic dividend will peak at 2041, where no. of people in the working age (20-59 years old) will peak. 

However if the govt doesn't invest in education and reforms the education system, since our education system is just rote learning and doesn't teach us to think critically, and it doesn't impart people with skills. The literacy rate of india according to 2011 census is only 74% and that vast majority even those who are literate do not receive quality education, it is said that 80% of engineering and MBA grads are unemployable , How will india progress?

Investing in education(and healthcare) is one of the best ways to raise the human capital(skills and expertise of the population).

Currently, india ranks 115 in human capital index. Having high human capital is crucial to economic development, increasing productivity, making progress in science and technology and innovation.

According to a report from world bank,[source](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00811/WEB/OTHER/9C8ACC61.HTM?OpenDocument). More than half the children in india are malnourished, 30% of newborns are underweight and 60% of women are anemic. Malnutrition costs india atleast about $10 billion or about Rs. 700 billion(Rs 70,000 crore) in terms of lost productivity , illness and deaths, which is about 23 times the cost of statue of unity.

If india doesn't invest more in education and health care, reforming education and health care system, improving the quality and infrastructure of govt schools and hospitals too, then we will hundreds of millions of unskilled and unproductive people in the future, which would be a disaster to development and progress.",">inequality will rise further and at some point it will stop, or the pyramid will fall flat on its face.

True. If inequality rises tremendously, the buying power of the poor will be almost wiped out. The Uber rich (producers), who depend on the consumption of their products by consumers will have to rethink everything then. Is the UBI somehow related to this thinking?

ei5wg9,SOCH-staymoderate,Science/Technology,Is the Dream of Kalam dead?,"2020 is finally on the doorstep. For most Indians who grew up in the last two decades, this was a year we were awaiting for, with hopes. Well, it was even more popular than scary-end-of-the-world predictions of 2012 among others! Well, for once hope won over fear!

Now that 2020 is on us, are we the India 2020 that was popularised by Dr. Abdul Kalam? 

That dream is officially 24 years old. Kalam and his team at TIFAC prepared a vision document for the country in 1996, a decade after TIFAC itself was born, incubated under the Dept. of Science & Technology. Kalam took as much pride in the document as in his successes with ISRO and DRDO.
TIFAC laid down a roadmap for sixteen sectors the country should focus on, with numerous sub-areas of technology assessed as the means to acheive it. TIFAC certainly inspired many govt. funded programmes and missions, including TIFAC-CORE which gave a major push for research infrastructure and Industry-academia interaction.

But will 2020 be the year that Kalam and others dreamt of? Most probably not, we are most likely just halfway in that journey. But on the optimistic side, haven't we grown in all terms in the last 24 years?

But it doesn't stop here, and we needn't dwell in regret. In 2015, TIFAC came up with a renewed mission Technology Vision 2035, a sort of version 2.0, in tune with the changes within India and around the world- a fresh technological roadmap for the country's progress. It's a document prepared with so much love, and all lovers of sci-tech should look into it. As the document says: 
""... while TV 2020 spoke to an aspiration of a developed India in 2020, TV 2035 speaks to the realisation of a developed India in 2035""

https://tifac.org.in/index.php/activities/technology-vision-2035

So lovers of science and the country, let's keep dreaming- this time more vividly and work more vigorously to give our tiny bit to it! :)

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now.

I have gap in my education does it matter when they perform background verification and terminate me afterwards?
 
My story is :- passed ssc in 2012 and 11th in 2013 , HSC in 2014 
But i got only 60% marks so i wasn't getting any engineering colleges so i decided to go for direct second year diploma for year 2015 and i failed in it. So i had to make exit from diploma and tried for HSC improvement for year 2016 . Got 62 and choose ""Computer science"" Btech . I'm expecting to get graduated by 2020. Now i have 2 jobs in my hand . Both are MNCs. There was no gap criteria mentioned for hexaware but i am not sure about infosys. But if it had been i wouldn't have had been selected. ( I mentioned 1 year of gap while giving first round of infosys, i got that round cleared too ) 

 Backround check usually happens with third party companies.   And as my portfolio looks life this
2012 SSC
2016 HSC 
2020 Btech 
We can see there is timeframe of 4 years between my 10th and 12th, but that is not even gap as first i gave HSC in 2014 , for 2015 i was pursuing diploma ( which i left )  and 2016 again got through HSC .

Does that show any discrepancy in my educational journey? 
Or background verification team just checks for your graduation marks ? Or will they ask me for more information before terminating me? If that happens :(

I passed 12th in 2018, and gave jee for the 1st time. Faired miserably and repeated a year and again gave it in 2019. Again didn't study properly and faired badly. Got into an okay okay private college called Heritage Institute of Technology in Kolkata. I'm studying ECE(Electronics and communication engineering) out there.

I've always wanted to study Computer science. With that in mind, I started trying to study discrete math from online resources. However, after finding the road too steep, I gave up. I thought, it'll be better to get a CS degree.

With that in mind, I decided to write Jee again.

In a private college, cracking GATE is my best option to go to a better place, but I doubt if I'll be capable enough to crack it and get into a better college. So I thought, better to write Jee again and try and get some private college with better placement opportunity so that I won't always be in uncertainty over my future.

But now, I don't know if this is the best decision. I don't know what to do. Whether to give up with Jee or continue. I sometimes feel embarrassed to give the exam again. I hate myself, my choices. I don't really know what I want from life. It's like I'm just doing things, not going anywhere - life has no direction.

1a2a9o,naveen_reloaded,Science/Technology,"Vigyan Prasar(VP) is an autonomous organisation under Department of Science and Technology , published this",,"Actually, many of the texts mentioned here do not exist or are proven rumors. It is true that Vimanas are mentioned in Ramayana and other texts. But, texts like Vaimanika Sastra are fabrications. 

>In 1875, the Vaimanika Sastra, a fourth century B.C. text written by Bharadvajy the Wise, using even older texts as his source, was rediscovered in a temple in India. It dealt with the operation of Vimanas and included information on the steering, precautions for long flights, protection of the airships from storms and lightening and how to switch the drive to ""solar energy"" from a free energy source which sounds like ""anti-gravity."" 

According to some sources, the book was pulled from the past by psychic powers (spirit channeling), not found in a temple. 


The IISc has [thoroughly](http://cgpl.iisc.ernet.in/site/Portals/0/Publications/ReferedJournal/ACriticalStudyOfTheWorkVaimanikaShastra.pdf) debunked the entire book. 

The book makes mention of things like:

Vehicles powered by donkey, elephant and cow urines.

* >...and several other materials including sixteen ‚Äòdrona‚Äô measures of donkey‚Äôs urine!

* >...ayaskanta soaked in elephant‚Äôs urine mixed with mercury.

* >Another vessel is to be filled with cow‚Äôs urine...

I'm a fresher and got placed from my college and working for around 2 months now, but wtf is people's obsession is with this field? It's not a field where you are earning a lot, or you are your own boss or even your job is respectful, even after 8-10 years when you become project manager you may earn 50-60 lpa, but still you're not like rich like you can do whatever you want, you're still blind by office timing, it's not like you can take a vacation whenever you want to.

Also, one of the important factors is that you health is gonna deteoriate, 9 hours in front of computer, and 3 hours in traffic for 5 days a week and wait for weekends to complete your sleep.
Also, if technology changes and you don't know that or do not learn the technology, your career takes a hit 
I just don't get it, the obsession behind the Computer Science field, why parents put this on their children? And how can they be proud of this? Like what are you proud of, that your child is sitting in front of computer for 9 hours, and work like a slave?",Mujhe Ek do zero kam pad gaye ,/r/india/comments/cwfx3i/why_is_engineering_so_promoted_across_india_and/
cep1qe,alertify,Science/Technology,"Trust yourself and do what you love - it works out, eventually. My story.","I am rather a Poor guy, who lost his father at the age of 3. Raised by Mom who worked at a private school.  

I opted for science after the board exams. Realized I won't even pass, had to fight with family members to change it to Commerce and I passed with 57% marks. 

Came to Mumbai to study CA, Estimated around 2.5 lakhs as fees & Expenses.   Couldn't afford that.  I  had interest in technology so decided to pursue it instead. 

Learned computer engineering (hardware networking) for one year  and got a job at a MNC, worked in that field for 6 years. I was just 17 when Joining this Job & a Didn't complete my Graduation. 

Around 5th year in my job I realized I had more interest in building things on the internet than fixing active directory problems. 


I started learning more and more about it, and build a real blog which got decent visitors and started to make some money.  But to really make something worthwhile I had to dedicate more time.  

I used to live in Virar and traveling to Andheri (Mumbai) every day for job took 9 hrs + 4 hrs of my time and after that hectic peak hour mumbai local the body simply didn't want to work anymore.  

So in around 2013 I left my job and decided to move full time into Internet marketing. 
My wife, her parents and my Mom all thought I have gone mad and pretty stupid. And honestly That's pretty much fucked up if you ask any one of that age. 

For next 12 months I built websites around local businesses in UK , ranked them and sold the leads to two companies. The most successful of them was one was around heavy transport vehicle driving training. The company paid $35 per lead and I made more than $4K per month (around 2L in INR) with it.  

This boosted my confidence and I invested most of those funds into experimenting and investing in digital marketing. 

I used to post my screenshots on Facebook, In 2014 a random dude msged out of nowhere and asked to meet.   He looked confident and we meet at a Google conference later that Week.  

We discussed what we both has been doing. He had lots of contacts at emerging companies and I had the skills, strategies , and contacts to actually delivery successful marketing campaigns.   it was a promising match and we end up forming a company together. 

We built a digital agency, the first client he brought gave us over two crores in revenue. We quickly built a team of about 40 ninjas and went on to become a very successful company. 

In next 3 years We worked with more than a dozen listed companies, 3 fortune 500 company and made a lot of money for ourselves.  

At materialistic levels, just last year he bought a very expensive car (80 lakhs), travelled to over 30 countries and I bought  a expensive home (3BHK powai - 2.5 cr).  

We are still partners and have been doing great so far and hopefully will continue to. 

At multiple times in my career I had to fight with my own people, go against the wind to make my way.  

Point of all this is, you reddit guys are tech adopters and are technically more advanced than the general public.  There is a lot of people who are stuck at a job they hate but can't do shit about it. Either for family pressure or a dozen different reasons. 

For You, I strongly recommend that in your free time develop a skill - mostly in a area you enjoy doing , and use that skill to compliment your primary source of income. 
Once you are confident enough and have some numbers (revenue) to back it up, take a leap of faith and see where it takes.   


Don't worry about failure - If you fail, getting a job is the easiest thing to do.   

I agree that the being a  entrepreneur is volatile and there is no security but so is everything else.  Just see how many people gets fired everymonth with no where to go and they all wonder if they could make something like that. 

Parents ko bus paise chaiye. As long as they see you are making good enough,  they will be fine. Sooner or later.   My father in-law loves to flaunt when I share my photos with a BMW and mom makes dozens of calls telling all relatives whenever she purchase something expensive.  

They just want to see you happy, it's just that their scale of happiness is a bit off.  Trust them to trust you.","Thanks for sharing your story, sir :) ",/r/india/comments/cep1qe/trust_yourself_and_do_what_you_love_it_works_out/
eh3s70,thruaway593,Science/Technology,Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?,"Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important.","Saara goo 'centre' me ikattha ho gaya hai, ab hame hi hataana padega ",/r/india/comments/eh3s70/will_the_conflict_between_india_and_pakistan_ever/

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

I have a couple of questions. 

1. How did you find the syllabus different from regular run of the mill engineering college.
1. How would you rate the seriousness and dedication of fellow students. 
1. The website tells me that most students do an internship at one of the ISRO facilities. Did you get such an opportunity ? How was your experience ? Did you contribute to an actual projects (even if in minuscule way)
1. And finally what's the employment situation like. Do a lot of people get absorbed into ISRO ? Do a lot of people like that or do you see a lot of ""brain drain"" ?
","No idea about IIST, but ISRO regularly launches various student satellites which piggyback with the main payloads.

Some friends of mine were involved in one and they got place their satellite in the rocket and monitor it from their base station etc. Pretty exciting stuff.

e2wq78,silver3forlife,Science/Technology,Need some career guidance (CS/IT),"Hi,

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.","are you talking about the coding prep coaching centers like coding blocks, coding ninja etc? ",/r/india/comments/e2wq78/need_some_career_guidance_csit/

So, I've decided to give myself a 2 month deadline to decide what other career to choose. And withing one month of deciding, I'll quit my job and embark on that new career. But, as of now, I'm looking for various options and I'm wondering whether you guys can help. So, here's my background/interests to help you help me:

1) Education: BE in CS branch. Abysmal Percentage/GPA.

2) 2 years of experience in Software field, of which I have no interest to continue. Neither am I interested in Data Science/AI or whatever other crappy buzzword that often gets thrown around.

3) I'm interested in Sociology/History/Literature/Politics etc. Can spend whole day in front of a book. Can spend time without getting bored watching, reading about these topics.

4) I'm a bit shy and introverted, but I'm confident of overcoming those.

5) No pressure to earn more money. Would be satisfied with bear minimum of 10-20k per month.

6) Ready to pursue any course in any other field (Banking etc)

ehzmtp,futuoerectus,Science/Technology,Let Us Begin the Next Decade Our Way,"Today, the end of a decade is upon us. While dates are just markers of time, they also have a psychological effect, the transition in to something new. On the eve of a new decade, this is my message to my fellow friends.

Friends,

Almost all of us have lived through the past decade. Some of you have even seen another momentous shift, ushering in the new millennium; while others have seen more of these events passing by.

The last ten years have redefined the way we live, and we are now even closer to each other. Things that were science fiction to a kid in the 1990s is a reality. Yet, we are using technology not to express ourselves but divide who we are collectively as humans. Algorithms are segmenting and compartmentalizing us on the basis of not only our ethnicity, but also our choices, our preferences and our actions. We are using all of the benefits of our interconnected ways in the worst ways possible; using it to gang up, humiliate and shame those that don't agree to our thoughts. We are still waging wars, and selling ourselves to be slaves for things that are pointless in the grand scheme of things.

However, today; you can stop that. You, yes you. You have the power to change, to redefine, to come together and fight all of the differences whose seeds are sown across our collective psyche. It is you who has the power to change your own life, and the power to change the lives of others around you. You may think you are an insignificant part amongst billions of people, but you're not. Today is the day you have the capability to lead by example, to create a harmonious future for the generation that comes after us, and most importantly, for yourself.

It is normal to fear, because I am afraid, more of myself and of failing others, but I am more afraid of failing to provide a better life for the next generation. But, it has to have a start somewhere, so why not today? I don't ask you of anything, but to do what your conscience thinks is right.

Thank you for reading.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays¬†| March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as ‚Äúthe Hindu rate of growth.‚Äù Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2¬†The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4¬†Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. ‚ÄúCollective learning‚Äù is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals‚Äîall these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds‚Äîit created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8¬†During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9¬†India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and ‚Äúmines of gold.‚Äù He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12¬†What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13¬†It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,‚Äù14¬†and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a ‚Äúper capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.‚Äù15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, ‚ÄúIn India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.‚Äù16¬†There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and ‚Äúdeindustrialized‚Äù India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule ‚Äúde-industrialised‚Äù India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant‚Äîby 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a ‚Äúdrain of wealth‚Äù, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment‚Äîthe so called ‚Äúhome charges‚Äù‚Äîwas in fact quite small.20¬†If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.‚Äù¬†22¬†The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence‚Äîand after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24¬†If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25¬†An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital‚Äîall of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26¬†But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not ‚Äúexploit‚Äù India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27¬†Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses‚Äîhence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace‚Äîthe Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution‚Äîan agricultural surplus‚Äîbut the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

‚Äú1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.‚Äù31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32¬†It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These ‚ÄúBangalores‚Äù have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù in world trade between 1950 and 1970; ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism‚Äîor rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These ‚Äúmillion negotiations of democracy‚Äù slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its ‚Äúlow level equilibrium‚Äù of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35¬†David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the ‚Äúotherworldly values of the Hindus‚Äù or the ‚Äúimmobilizing effects of the caste system‚Äù and the ‚Äúconservative habits of the merchant caste‚Äù. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that ‚Äúpeople would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.‚Äù37¬†It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs‚Äîit has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (‚Äúremove English from primary schools‚Äù). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


","1) I have a major issue in asking the descendents of colonial British to atone for the sins of their ancestors. We don't ask for the Iranians or the Afghans or the Marathas to apologise for the acts of their ancestors (Nadir Shah, Abdali et al)  which were as brutal as anything the British conjured. responsibility. (or at least we shouldn't)

2)Two centuries of colonial rule has to be seen in the context and morality of its time. Conquest of territory by force was completely acceptable until the 20th century. Indeed that is how all Indian empires were built.The assumption that any other native monarchy would be gentler than the British is extremely naive. 

3) let us not assume we don't whitewash history of our national heroes. Ashoka is seen as a great king (which he was) despite Kalinga and the various massacres mentioned in the Ashoka vadana. So is Akbar (siege of Chittor). Any time we call out the British, it is rank hypocrisy ",/r/india/comments/6zeuk0/i_find_rindia_circlejerking_too_much_over_shashi/

6t66al,finalbeer,Non-Political,[Non-Political] Vodafone had been extorting my balance for the past 2 months and blocking my calls to their customer care number.,"So for the past 2 months Vodafone has been tormenting me. Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles?

6izxwj,Responsbile_Indian,Non-Political,[Non-Political][Serious]: What's your thoughts on GST now?,"1st of all; I'm not looking for political circle-jerking. I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn‚Äôt solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn‚Äôt pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It‚Äôs far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. ‚ÄúGiven the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.

These are some uninspiring thoughts when we have poured in years of work to learn, unlearn, build, dismantle, and assemble again. 

Some jumping ship, some hanging around fighting for the cause; begging, borrowing, appropriating, somehow, you do everything to never let doubts creep into your mind. 

Some nights are spent, staring at a blank screen, unresponsive code, a sad prototype of the dream that you chase.

Some days are spent, evaluating yourself, if the sum total of your life was a failure that was staring you in the face each day, each night. Your self-worth becomes zero, you become completely undesirable to people who probably loved you once, you have already jerked off to all the porn that you could handle.

By this time, all your friends have become your creditors, with lines of credits exhausted, you scroll your contact list constantly to find that one person, not to seek funds, but to talk with.
We try to hark back for simpler times, reminiscence the moments that made us laugh, then, but we hope probably it would bring an honest smile to our face ‚Äì our smiles that we had pawned off we did not know when, to users, downloads, sessions and GMVs.

Then one day, you come home, stare at the blank screen, try to make sense of things, break down, and just before letting go of everything seems like an option. You think of Ali, you think of Lincoln, you seek wisdom in the hymns of Nanak, and sagacity and enlightenment from Bhagvad Gita; but you know who comes to your rescue, Earnest Hemingway.

*You are not made for defeat, you can be destroyed, but not defeated.*

To further (mis)quote Hemingway, sometimes our actions are not immediately discernible and when we try for something beyond attainment, something that has never been done, and things that others have tried and failed, and perhaps with ‚Äòkarma‚Äô you will succeed.

1xb2ni,alphonse23,Non-Political,Could someone give me advice on approaching an Indian girl? [Non-Political],"I am not Indian. Said Indian girl is a coworker. I work at an American tech company (Indian coworkers not surprising). I'm pretty sure she is Indian Indian (not American Indian) based on her style of dress -- so very likely either she moved here for a job or went to grad school here and accepted a job here and stayed (which seems to be a common scenario amongst many Indian tech workers).

She does this really unusual thing where she goes to the break room, drinks water from a new cup, then throws it into the trash (somewhat dramatically) -- wasting a perfectly clean styrofoam cup that's only had water in it. (Which I consider very wasteful -- it's a styrofoam cup and it's non-biodegradable). It seems a little unusual, but I‚Äôm not sure, it could be normal behavior where she comes from.

Though‚Ä¶

My feelings certainly wouldn't be hurt if she wasn't interested. The only reason why I feel the need to approach is because when I first started working at this company there was a lot of eye contact (her fault -- my fault -- IDK). And I have been getting the distinctive feeling that she'd like me to talk to her (though I'm not really sure).

So, what's an acceptable way to start a conversation with an Indian women? From reading about India on reddit and elsewhere, I've heard the culture is very chauvinistic, and that women shouldn't walk alone at night, and that generally woman are off limits in most cases. I‚Äôve heard this from both non-Indians and Indians. And also heard that relationships between men and woman are usually arranged by their parents (and I think Gandhi practiced this, though I don't think it's common practice today) ‚Äì and so maybe this is why there are no acceptable ways of approaching females.

I‚Äôm not trying to be offensive and I don‚Äôt‚Äô mean to sound ignorant ‚Äì but I feel like this is the only way to really gather acceptable cultural practices ‚Äì through word-of-mouth and anecdotal, folk experiences. 

I'm only asking what's an acceptable way of approaching (as in starting a conversation) with an Indian female -- that could possibly be romantic in nature (I hate saying this..), but without any possibility of coming of as offensive, or as harassment, or in anyway seeming as ""negative"" in intentions.","that's a good thing.

Need guidance from those who have been in interviews before.","The title is too TL;DR. I'm a South Indian male in Maharashtra and I have applied to Christ College in Banglore (which happens to be my native place, sort of) for a triple major programme (BA PSEng and PSEco) and my interview is on the 13th of May. Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

.


What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

.

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

dc6k28,desikid25,Photography,[SERIOUS] How would people in India react if someone started posting erotic/implied nude photography on Instagram?,"PS: I‚Äôm going to be as specific as possible so people here can actually tell how others, specially my friends, college teachers etc might react. I‚Äôve also added serious tag so that the replies don‚Äôt turn into sarcastic/joke types. 

I‚Äôm an Indian guy in my mid twenties working abroad. I like to do photography as a hobby in my free time although art of any form but mainly paintings and movies have always been something I‚Äôve been very interested in. Lately I started shooting female portraits which involves mostly European and sometimes Asian women. I post all my work on Instagram where my friends and even teachers from school follow me.

So far my friends and colleagues etc have been really appreciating my photos. Some of them were very impressed since I do feel my photos are good and stand out. Surprisingly I‚Äôve received better feedback from my female friends.

Now I‚Äôm thinking of starting erotic/boudoir photography which involves women in very less clothing. Some of that also involves nude women where nudity is implied i.e. breasts hidden by hand etc (no frontal nudity). Something along the lines of playboy shoots. I have couple of shoots already planned with two  European girls.

I‚Äôm not someone who cares much about what others think but I‚Äôm a bit concerned if this is going to have a bad impact on me in any way that I am unaware of. I mean any way this can have a bad effect. In terms of reputation or how people may react or perceive me etc. I‚Äôm especially not sure how Indian people would react to this and if I‚Äôm going to be viewed in a negative way. Thanks for reading.","Oh haha, sorry lol. ",/r/india/comments/dc6k28/serious_how_would_people_in_india_react_if/

3. What are different types of career options like I'm planning to do Product photography but what other than that, Wedding, etc.?
4. I'm about to complete my Bachelor's of Pharmacy (don't ask why Pharmacy, it just happened) but should I go for Masters Degree in Photography, I'm 22 years old.
5. What are good institution for photography courses and how to get an admission in them & other local classes where there are 6 months starter courses?
6. Where and how can I find work?","I started with HTML and CSS. Lots of tutorials on YouTube for that.

Since my high school, photography is something that has always interested me and made my eyes sparkle in a unexplainable way. Everytime I scroll through Instagram, there is a cry inside me to try to make it as a photographer.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?
Or is the risk that I'm taking too huge and should I just stick to finding an engineering job?",This was helpful. I'll surely look into it. Thanks. ,/r/india/comments/c539gl/advice_for_an_engineer_inclined_towards/

es78p7,casey_h6,Photography,Visiting India,"Hello everyone,

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

If anyone has any questions for me I'd love to talk as well, it's always interesting to learn about others culture.","Thank you for the info.

2. Photographers who can guide and help me through, I am willing to assist and work under you. (I will be staying in Mumbai in the month of June.)
3. Any workshops/talks/courses I can attend? 


Ping me if you are experienced and could discuss this with me. 

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them. 
As of now I have just tried my hand in Phone Photography and uploaded pictures on my Instagram. The photos I click are sometimes personal to what I relate to and often open to interpretation.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out.","Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

So your best bet is to take some good photographs which you clicked and send it to a potential guide.

ciddbn,fuckyallmat,Photography,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)

dcqkjk,sleepygamer92,Photography,Watching movies in India is a truly unique experience.,"Seriously, there is no dearth of weird shit that can happen. I went to watch Joker in an afternoon show and here is a list of things that happened.

1. Some guys came with Heath Ledger type facepaint and saste ka clown masks. They were denied entry because they didn't have ID to prove they were above 18. This bunch of Joker ""anarchists"" was then seen begging the security to let them in.

2. I overheard a guy was telling his girlfriend that Heath Ledger would make a cameo in this movie. I thought he was pranking her but he seemed to be convinced.

3. Another group of people (who I had the unfortunate experience of sitting next to later) were chanting anarchy slogans as they entered the theater. They were asked to shut up by the ushers. These same bunch proceeded to take videos and photos of ""iconic"" clips from the movie, sometimes with their flash on. Thankfully they were thrown out.

4. Someone's family member apparently died/hospitalized in the climax of the movie and he began crying loudly while on the call. He ran out after a few seconds but some people who were next to him were genuinely confused about whether to ask him to shut up or not.

5. I spotted a celebrity photographer in the theater watching the movie with his wife. I used to love his early work and it sort of inspired me into getting into amateur photography. I was contemplating throughout the movie what I will say to him or will he be cool to take a picture with me etc. I had them locked on while they were exiting and ended up standing right next to them in the dark exit hallway walking out. As I was about to talk to him, he and his wife started having an argument. I just continued walking past them and left thanks to the awkwardness.

Thoughts about the movie? It's great. Just try going for a show where you can avoid the college crowd. Dunno why these people worship The Joker.","yeah it was said in the normiest intention possible

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India?

fupeo0,abbawaddadu,Policy/Economy,We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT),"People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",All we can do now is to pray all this gets over ,/r/india/comments/fupeo0/we_would_have_gone_into_a_recession_regardless_of/

Yet Minister of State of Finance Anurag Thakur says ""no impact on Economy"". Nirmala doesn't care as she doesn't invest in stocks. Modi is fakir aadmi. Unsurprisingly chaddy gaumutra drinkers dont have any come back to this kind of facts.

Not only has yes bank failed but with Supreme court order on Vodafone AGR dues, this is likely to cause over 20,000 crore of NPAs on top banks, including SBI and IndusInd. It wont be surprising to see another bank fail and get saved by cashpayers money.

Moreover Vodafone a large international company failing due to GOI greed will be death knell of foreign investments into India. Imagine a govt so careless they allow such a large company such as vodafone to go bankrupt due to utter stupid policies. This govt has managed to destroy one of the most promising sectors telecom into a duopoly.

Even liquid funds are crashing hard as even GOI defaulting cannot be ruled out at this point. Lot of RBI money has gone into cleaning up the mess created by DeMo, GST, saving private banks, etc. While other countries are announcing several billion dollars of corona relief, there is nothing really left in terms of relief to Indian citizens.


During recession, you need actual economists like Manmohan Singh and Raghuram Rajan steering the ship, not war mongers like Anurag Thakur and Nirmala tai.

66u52j,ringtring,Policy/Economy,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica ‚Äî all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",Aren't there any barriers set for Chinese imports ? China is dumping goods around the world. It's not a LDC.

As for Central Planning how do you think large corporations work? I mean do employees just walk in and dream? The very fact that mega corporations exists mean Central Planning works all too well.

Your idea that public services won't work even if funded and staffed is pure ideology and a counterfactual. You can't make an argument about what isn't there. ""If my grandmother had balls, she'd be my grandfather"" 
Also, if you do an analysis you'll see that not only do well funded public services work. They work very well Indeed. To take an example, Delhi Metro. Owned by the Delhi Government.  Or the world's best metro, Seoul Metro, owned by the Seoul Government. I'd give you examples of Europe but then you'll scream ""Scandinavia isn't Socialism"". Well let's try and have that?

They are eroding the trust of the Indian currency from citizens, investors and other organisations.

EDIT:Some of you think all the fuck ups that are brewing are my fault just because i once voted for modi.We didn't know that this was going to happen.We chose a narcissist over a retard.We rode the wave like many others.So don't act all high and mighty .If you knew this was going to happen,where were you back in 2014 and 2019 huh?Its easy to talk big when its all said and done.Its better to look for an alternative rather than playing the blame game.



EDIT 2 : i have come to the conclusion that most of you find the fact and reason that i voted for modi hard to swallow.Yes i admit that i made a mistake when i thought he is a Guju and he might have a business plan for our country.Turns out he did have business plans but only for Ambani.It was ignorance on my part when i thought the 2002 incidents were not Modi's fault.Most of his other policies were not well thought and anti Muslim.You can all blame me for voting for Modi and still be chin deep in shit or Give reasonable contentions that might help.i personally don't like the idea of voting for Rahul.But now if i had to,i would choose Rahul over Modi.But wouldn't it be better if congress chose a new PM candidate like Tharoor.I have a hunch that Modi will not be around for long.Aggressive sophomaniac piece of shits need not reply.",exactly as long as we give him the honour and respect. ,/r/india/comments/f9m7zf/i_want_mr_manmohan_singh_as_my_pm/
flm4j5,ShortTesla_Rekt5,Policy/Economy,Central Government has failed to even approve COVID19 diagnostic kits. Complete failure of governance during pandemic,"This govt suggest gaumutr cures for COVID while simultaneously failing to provide clearances for test kits, so that more people can get tested. This is abject failure of policy. 

**While the US Food and Drug Administration gave clearance for diagnostic tests for Covid-19 within 24 hours of application by two companies, [in India a handful of companies looking to get their tests validated have been waiting for a month](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/companies-wait-weeks-for-coronavirus-test-validation/articleshow/74701811.cms), or more in some cases.**



It seems the govt is clueless about even providing testing kits clearances. How can you expect such a clueless government to provide the best response for a fast spreading pandemic? 

When people keep drinking gaumutr and voting for ram mandir and statues, a clueless government is what you will get. 

Almost every major country has announced billions $ of rescue packages. Trump has even publicly identified industries like aviation tourism etc which have been hit hard, and the US govt will publicly aid the companies in these sectors. Indian govt meanwhile has said [No adverse impact on economy due to COVID-19](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/no-adverse-impact-on-economy-due-to-covid-19-anurag-thakur-814890.html). Indian businesses ranging from airlines to travel, tourism, malls, daily groceries have all been affected  yet not a word has been said about helping the affected industries. 

Chaddies do not have intelligence and thus cannot be expected to vote wisely. That is why chaddies were ruled with an iron hand by kings throughout history, even chaddis wet dream kingdom of ram rajya was autocratic dictatorship and not a democracy. Now chaddi clad sanghie bhaktas are exhibiting their clueless in exercising their franchise, resulting in great damage to India as a whole.","Testing asymptomatic people would be a massive waste of resources tho, we can't test a billion people. We could be testing everyone who shows symptoms, but practically, all the test does provide some clarity, it's not like there is any cure. We could instead suggest anyone showing symptoms to isolate themselves, and focus on actually treating cases. 

Most importantly, right now we don't have a single large cluster, like lombardy or Wuhan, so where do we ramp up our tests?

The taxes on Petrol and Diesel have grown by over 100% in the tenure of Modi government. While the other big economies are trying to ensure that they do not go in economic slump by easing their monetary policy, India is busy dampening consumer confidence.

This news closely follows another one where the Modi government fired Urjit PATEL for not financing 1.56L crores worth of government expenditure.

The markets are reeling heavily downwards under pressure due to C scare, and it is very likely that the investors will pull out their investments from higher risk based emerging economies. In a looming recession, the growth can flee and the institutional investors may pull out in hoards.

The Indian banks are failing and the modi government is further dampening the consumer confidence by raising taxes on staple like Petrol. The recent drop in oil prices was perfect opportunity for the government to announce a reduction.

fxmvof,DheerajKochhar,Policy/Economy,ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate,"  

***LOCK ‚Äì ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would‚Äôve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world‚Äôs population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today‚Äôs situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren‚Äôt performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, ‚ÄúOut of Adversity comes Opportunity‚Äù. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‚ÄòHome‚Äô is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector‚Äôs growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India‚Äôs GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector‚Äôs contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India‚Äôs GDP by 2025.

¬∑ **Real Estate ‚Äì Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India‚Äôs Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

¬∑ **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

¬∑ **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

¬∑ **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

¬∑ **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

¬∑ **Long Term ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Wealth Building Asset with ‚ÄúPredictable ‚Äú Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **‚ÄúPredictable‚Äù Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Capital Appreciation in long term**, don‚Äôt be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company‚Äôs stock price or your bank‚Äôs health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

¬∑ **‚ÄúHelps you Raise Money Quickly‚Äù** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

¬∑ **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **‚ÄúWine and Real Estate improve with Age‚Äù** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

¬∑ **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

¬∑ **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

¬∑ **Co-living market** size across India‚Äôs top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

¬∑ **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

¬∑ India‚Äôs improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why ‚Äì**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand ‚Äì Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it‚Äôs time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor‚Äôs portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual‚Äôs cash flow and wealth.

**‚ÄúBUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don‚Äôt WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ‚Çπ4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.  (Source - ['Direct tax collection up since demonetisation'](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/direct-tax-collection-up-since-demonetisation/articleshow/69077749.cms) and [What demonetisation did to tax collections](https://www.thehindu.com/business/what-demonetisation-did-to-tax-collections/article23550004.ece))

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post.

This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

f15kgm,Sulh-i-kul,Policy/Economy,Opinion: BJPs policies have alienated a large section of Middle Class Hindus,"One of India's Election Commissioners, Ashok Lavasa, in a brilliant [recent ](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-difficulty-of-being-honest-prevention-of-corruption-act-ashok-lavasa-election-commission-of-india-6188078/)article  wrote,""People are generally good; they are also generally timid"". And I think it defines our middle classes perfectly.

India has always had an aspirational middle class. This middle class is largely moderate, driven by ambitions of economic prosperity and social stability (just like the middle classes of any other country). They want to be socially and economically upwardly mobile, resent overtly divisive policies with uncertain ends and are busy in their lives (thus the timidity).

Now, the point of a democratic society is democratic changes (a.k.a gradual changes). There's a reason we're regarded as elephants and China's as a dragon. We praise China for what they've done with their economy but hold dear what we have i.e our voice.

Modi Govt seems to be constantly stirring the pot with radical policies. This has started affecting the lives of a common Indian more than ever, and negatively too. Modi supporter or not, demonetisation, for example, in hindsight, is uniformly chided for being wasteful and avoidable.

Middle and lower middle classes will now increasingly start disassociating with what this govt stands for. The CAA crackdown, kashmir situation but most importantly the incompetent handling of the economy will soon have them looking for viable alternatives. A BJP, which for the longest time stood for economic liberalisation, corruption-free politics, efficient governance - atleast in the minds of the educated - now stands exposed with its vitriolic campaigns and its ineptitude to handle nuanced issues like the Kashmir problem. 

I see a political vacuum forming soon, and a desperate search for alternatives by the upwardly mobile middle and lower middle classes and an opportunity for something new.","Yep. Would probably suit you and your argument better had i claimed I hated BJP since forever. I don't see any point in lying just to hop on to what you think is the more virtuous side.

 I felt BJP was the best option in 2014, but it's policies subsequently underscored that it largely wanted to push its own social agenda. The tipping point for me was yogi's appointment. I still remember India growing by almost 8% then.

Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.","Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal.

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them.

fjkxnm,Desipornthrowaway,Policy/Economy,Why Russia in the Revolution of 1905 is analogous to India today,"Russia in 1905 was controlled by a very hated Tsar. He was in control only because he controlled the police and media. The courts were also controlled by him and thus no real justice was possible. 

Ring a bell? Read on. 

He ruled only for the vested big industry and land owners. They made policies and he simply was their puppet. Farmers were in distress and yes you also had farmer suicide but the Tsar didn't care because his sycophants told him he was the best Tsar ever and that the Economy and people were in great shape?

 Ding ding ding. 

Now in 1904 and 1905 began a series of mass democratic protests, all inorganic and a will of the people. Did the Tsar listen to them? No, he ignored them at best and at worst unleashed his army and police on unarmed masses murdering them by the 1,000's. 

You have made the connection haven't you. 

As this was all making the Tsar look bad, a group of fascists called the Black Hundreds, supported by the police came up. Like the RSS today they were a fascist mob who used the support of the state to silence dissenting voices by violence. Now go read about them and you will see that they mirror the RSS exactly. A summary from Wikipedia. 

>The Black Hundreds were also noted for extremism and incitement to¬†pogroms,¬†nationalistic¬†Russocentric¬†doctrines, different¬†xenophobic¬†beliefs, including¬†anti-Ukrainian sentiment[4]¬†and¬†anti-semitism.

Replace russocentric with Hindutva and anti Ukrainian with Bangladesh and semitism with Islam and you have the exact same Ideology. 

Whenever a peaceful protest came up, these thugs will show up, murder the peace loving protestors while the police turned a blind eye. 

This is exactly the same as India under the Fascist thug Modi.

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ‚Çπ1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now ‚Äî about ‚Çπ10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ‚Çπ3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ‚Çπ3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",The gov want to restart the economy. I have no issue with that. But to start this stage of the virus where cases have just started to come out that's risky. Instead of stopping it this measure may accelerate the spread. Imo wait a month. Start restarting d economy from next month. ,/r/india/comments/fzfkko/lives_livelihoods_in_india/

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis**

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government‚Äôs actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy‚Äîsomething long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country‚Äôs economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions‚Äîsome of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming‚Äîespecially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential‚Äîwhich some argue is around 8-8.5%‚Äîas the government‚Äôs spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over‚Äîindeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government‚Äôs anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework‚Äîexactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

‚ÄúThe deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI‚Äôs initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,‚Äù and then added, ‚ÄúWe believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks‚Äô balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.‚Äù

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

### 1)¬†SARS-¬≠CoV-¬≠2¬†

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer¬≠reviewed, open¬≠access journal ‚ÄòEmerging Microbes and Infections‚Äô has cautioned that SARS¬≠-CoV-¬≠2, the virus causing the COVID-¬≠19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-¬≠2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What‚Äôs more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID¬≠19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ¬≠fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ¬≠ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ¬≠ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‚Äòsevere condition‚Äô. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019¬≠nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.¬† In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2)¬†G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world‚Äôs largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of ‚ÄúRealizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All‚Äù.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF‚Äô Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a ‚ÄúV-shaped, rapid recovery‚Äù for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world‚Äôs largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world‚Äôs population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 4)¬†Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae

A group of scientists has recently discovered a new species of land snail in Brunei.

* The new species reside in tropical rainforests and are sensitive to drought and extreme temperatures (which have become more frequent due to climate change).
* Hence as an honor to Swedish Climate Change activist Greta Thunberg, who has been making efforts to raise awareness about climate change, the new snail species was named Craspedotropis Gretathunbergae.
* Recently, a tiny species of beetle was also named after her as Nelloptodes Greta.
* In 2018, a new species of beetle (Grouvellinus Leonardodicaprioi) was named after the actor Leonardo DiCaprio (an American actor, producer, and environmentalist).

### 5)¬†Biodiversity management committees (BMC)

The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) is set to tell the National Green Tribunal that it created 243,499 biodiversity management committees (BMC) and 95,525 people‚Äôs biodiversity registers (PBR) as of January 2020.

#### Background:

NGT is hearing a case on the full implementation of the Biodiversity Act, 2002.

#### Biodiversity Management Committees (BMC)

* As per the Biological Diversity Act 2002, BMCs are created for ‚Äúpromoting conservation, sustainable use and documentation of biological diversity‚Äù by local bodies across the country.
* Composition:
   * It shall consist of a chairperson and not more than six persons nominated by the local body, of whom not less than one third should be women and not less than 18% should belong to the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes.
   * The Chairperson of the Biodiversity Management Committee shall be elected from amongst the members of the committee in a meeting to be chaired by the Chairperson of the local body.
   * The chairperson of the local body shall have the casting votes in case of a tie.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force‚Äôs fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 8)¬†Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh‚Äôs border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state‚Äôs foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

### 9)¬†Amendments in Arms Act, 1959 and Arms Rules, 2016 notified

* Shooting is an important Olympic sport in India. The Indian shooters have excelled in international competitions. Keeping this in mind, the Ministry of Home Affairs, vide its notification issued under the Arms Act 1959, has made provisions to provide adequate firearms and ammunition to the shooters for their practice. The Ministry of Home Affairs vides its notifications dated 12th February 2020 has amended the provisions of the Arms Act, 1959 and the Arms Rules, 2016 to increase the number of firearms that can be kept by the shooters and enhanced the quantity of ammunition fixed for their practice for the year. These provisions shall greatly facilitate their shooting practice.
* As per the new rules, now International Medalists/Renowned Shooters are allowed to keep additional weapons up to a total of twelve under the exempted category, which earlier was seven. If a shooter is renowned in one event, he can keep maximum eight (previously it was four), if a shooter is renowned in two events he can keep maximum ten (previously it was seven) and if a shooter is renowned in more than two events, he can keep maximum twelve (previously it was seven) firearms under exempted category. The junior target shooter/ aspiring shooter is now allowed to possess two weapons (previously one) of any category in which the person is a junior target shooter/aspiring shooter. This provision shall facilitate shooters in practicing with various types of firearms. Apart from the above exemptions, the shooters are entitled to possess two firearms as normal citizens under provisions of the Arms Act, 1959.
* Similarly, by amending the provision under Rule 40 of the Arms Rules, 2016 the quantity of ammunition that can be purchased by the shooters during the year for the practice has also been increased considerably. As per the new provisions, for .22 LR rifle/pistol 5000 instead of 1000, for another type of Pistol/Revolver 2000 instead of 600 and for shotgun calibers 5000 instead 500 can be purchased by the shooters.
* Apart from this, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also made other necessary amendments in the Arms Rules, 2016 by amending the Arms Act, 1959, vide the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019. Through these amendments, it has also been clarified that no license is required for Indian citizens for acquisitions, possession of small arms falling under the category of curio. However, an appropriate license as prescribed would be required for use or to carry or transport such as small arms. Without the endorsement of such firearms in the prescribed license of the owner, no ammunition shall be sold for their use.
* It may be noted that as per the provisions of the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019, the maximum number of firearms to be possessed by any person has been reduced from three to two. Those in possession of three firearms have been given the facility to retain any two of such firearms and to deposit the remaining firearm by 13.12.2020.

### 10)¬†Corporates join Ganga Rejuvenation effort

* A tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed¬†between the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), State Program Management Group-Uttarakhand (SPMG-UK) and Indorama Charitable Trust (ICT) to work together for renovation/ development of the Ghat at Badrinath and Ghats and Crematoria at Gangotri in Uttarakhandat a total cost of 26.64 Crore.
* Rivers in India have always been considered sacred and the Ganga river, in particular, is the identity and lifeline of India. Pilgrim sites and urban centers have developed along the river. These centers have drawn sustenance from the river and have been thriving over time. Ghats and Crematoria are part of the lifestyle of people and pilgrimages to visit the holy river Ganga play a vital role in strengthening the People-River Connect. Gangotri and Badrinath being part of the Char Dham yatra, are especially important. This MoU is a significant step for improving amenities and sanitation at these holy locations with the underlying spirit of partnership and of private corporates taking responsibility by contributing to the National Mission: Rejuvenation of the sacred river Ganga.
* The Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been developed by M/S WAPCOS, a Govt. of India Enterprise.
   * The activities under the project include:
      * Construction of Bathing Ghats and Crematoria
      * Repair and modernization of existing Ghats and Crematoria
      * Providing public amenities on Ghats
      * Bank erosion protection works
      * Operation & Maintenance (O&M) for 5 years
      * Work is expected to start by March 2020 and likely to be completed in 15 months. This MoU is effective for 7 years.

He always touts his horns when representing india by elevating it as world largest democracy. 

Now what ? World's largest democracy' economy is probably will be in ruins by the time this is all over. 

As far as I have gathered:- 

He's not really giving people any financial support. He only urged people to not leave the disadvantaged behind. I understand that. But dude, even people who will be paying them will have no income stream left. 

So what maybe you pay your employees. Will your landlord be generous enough to forget your monthly payments. Maybe he is, but now even he has to pay property tax without any income stream.

He's not providing tax cuts or financing salaries of people. 

Now when this shit storm is all over he doesn't even have any policies if place if he decides a full lockdown. Many business will become bankrupt. Many company will be dissolved. It will be a period of unstable financial turmoil. Many life's will be ruined and that fucker will still not be accountable for all his action ( like erection of 3000 crore statue ) or rather his inaction. 

This could very well lead to another event like Great Depression. Without support from government many people will be laid off and many will become bankrupt.

As important as it is to get work turning out, it is more important to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees. Fortunately, we at Lohono Stays have managed to tackle the challenge caused by this pandemic. Realising the density of the situation soon enough, we were able to proactively apply the work from home policy.

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.

fqqi9p,Pheonix-_,Policy/Economy,India's forsaken IT / BPO and other professionals post COVID-19 breakout and Lock-down.," As of 5th of March NASSCOM had sought permission from Govt to allow Work from Home [WFH](https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.economictimes.com/news/economy/policy/coronavirus-nasscom-urges-govt-to-allow-techies-to-work-from-home/amp_articleshow/74487287.cms) to deal with COVID-19 & permission granted by the 13th of March. Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The attention to the state of the Indian economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. Photo: AP

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government‚Äôs actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy‚Äîsomething long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country‚Äôs economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions‚Äîsome of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming‚Äîespecially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential‚Äîwhich some argue is around 8-8.5%‚Äîas the government‚Äôs spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over‚Äîindeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government‚Äôs anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework‚Äîexactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

‚ÄúThe deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI‚Äôs initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,‚Äù and then added, ‚ÄúWe believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks‚Äô balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.‚Äù

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

	1.	Are NRC and CAA separate?

Yes. 

NRC is not a law, It is a process mandated by  the Indian Citizenship ( Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules 2003.
Source

But are they connected? 

YES.

Since any rules issued from time to time by the government are taken into consideration while interpreting any law. In fact there is a clause in every Act specifying the same, in our case, Section 18 of the Indian Citizenship Act 1955.

Source

	2.	What is the CAA, how can it be misused?

(a) CAA and why it‚Äôs unconstitutional

The core idea is to make it easier for  undocumented immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get Indian citizenship. The catch is that these immigrants can‚Äôt be Muslims.

Are there really ‚Äòpersecuted minorities‚Äô that would benefit from this legislation?

Yes, 31,313 individuals to be precise.
This was revealed by the government itself during a hearing by a parliamentary committee on the 2016 version of the Bill. The committee had asked how many people would benefit from the legislation. The Intelligence Bureau replied:


But by specifically excluding Muslims (and Jews), the Bill has raised justified concerns that the Modi government is trying to enshrine religious discrimination into law. 

This when Article 14 of India‚Äôs constitution prohibits discrimination on religious basis.

Why does this Act violate Article 14?

Article 14 is Equality of Law.

‚Äòthe state shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of laws within the territory of India prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth‚Äô

The opposition MPs had pointed this out but Amit Shah insisted the exception to Article 14, ‚Äúreasonable classification‚Äù when making laws. 

In simple words the State can discriminate between citizens on above grounds if special benefits are offered to them for eg; reservations for marginalised communities.

This matter of whether ‚Äúreasonable classification‚Äù is justified is why the Act is being contended in the Courts and will be decided later.

(b) How can CAA be misused?

CAA can be amended only by parliamentary procedures. 

The government has said that the amendment was made to provide remedy to the six communities namely Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan seeking shelter from religious persecution or fear of religious persecution.

However, religious persecution is not cited anywhere in the CAA, 2019. The bare act reads:

""Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government by or under clause (c) of sub-section (2) of section 3 of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or from the application of the provisions of the Foreigners Act, 1946 or any rule or order made thereunder, shall not be treated as illegal migrant for the purposes of this Act;"" 



Religious persecution is actually mentioned under the Rules to the amended Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920.



This is very important to understand because the Government can make changes to these rules anytime they want. Rules are basically subordinate laws that the central government can issue through a gazette notification at any time. These laws do not require the approval of the parliament.


*The above point will be important while explaining NRC.

3. What is the NRC?

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a registry maintained by the Government of India containing names & certain relevant information for identification of Indian citizens. 

The Nationwide NRC is as a process already underway through the NPR, which is proposed to be implemented in the 2021 census.

(a) What is the NPR?

The NPR is a list of ‚Äúusual residents of the country‚Äù. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, a ‚Äúusual resident of the country‚Äù is one who has been residing in a local area for at least the last six months, or intends to stay in a particular location for the next six months. 

Unlike the NRC, the NPR is not a citizenship enumeration drive, as it would record even a foreigner staying in a locality for more than six months.
 It is mandatory for every ‚Äúusual resident of India‚Äù to register in the NPR.

The NPR will collect both demographic data and biometric data. There are 15 different categories of demographic data, ranging from name and place of birth to education and occupation, that the RGI is supposed to collect in the NPR. 

For biometric data it will depend on Aadhaar, for which it will seek Aadhaar details of the residents. This will allow the Union government, for the first time, to connect their biometric details with information like the birthplace of their parents.

Apart from this, in a test run going on across the country, the RGI is seeking details of mobile number, Aadhaar, PAN card, Driving Licence, Voter ID card and passport (in case the resident is Indian). It is also working to update the Civil Registration System of birth and death certificates.

Even as issues of privacy associated with Aadhaar continue to be debated in the country, the NPR is on a drive to collect detailed data on residents of India. With the recent introduction of Personal Data Protection Bill, in which the Centre exempts its agencies from some or all provisions of the proposed bill there are a lot of red flags being raised about misuse of such data.

Source

(b) How is NPR linked to the NRC?

The legal framework for the National Population Register is grounded in the Citizenship Act, 1955. In 2003, the Act was amended by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government to introduce the category of an ‚Äúillegal migrant‚Äù. To implement this amendment, a set of rules were issued. 

(The link to the rules is the same as 1. Are CAA and NRC different)

The rules read: ‚ÄúThe Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status‚Äù.

How would these registers of citizens be created? The rules explicitly spell it out: 

‚ÄúThe Local Register of Indian citizens shall contain details of persons after due verification made from the Population Register.‚Äù

When the Local Register is generated from the Population Register, a ‚Äúverification process‚Äù would be carried out which would create the category of ‚Äúdoubtful citizenship‚Äù. 

The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a ‚Äúclaims and objections‚Äù process.

This Population Register mentioned in the rules is nothing other than the National Population Register.

Link
 In a gazette notification issued on July 31, 2019, the Modi government passed an order to ‚Äúprepare and update the Population Register‚Äù in every state other than Assam.

(c) Arguments against NRC.

	(i).	A botched exercise in Assam

The National Register of Citizens in Assam was updated over the past few years to identify undocumented migrants who had come mostly from Bangladesh after 1971. 

The updated NRC was supposed to document all those people whose names were listed in the NRC of 1951 and were still alive as well as their living descendants who could prove they were permanent residents of the state.

It was a botched exercise. There were many errors during the process.
Source

 In all, around 19 lakh people in Assam were excluded from the final register. 
Source

Soon, the BJP started complaining that many undocumented immigrants had been included in the register, while around five lakh Bengali Hindus were excluded. In fact, even some people who had campaigned for the BJP found themselves excluded.

Source: BJP complaining about a botched NRC
Source: 5 lakh Bengali Hindus excluded in NRC
Source: BJP campaigners find themselves excluded

Anyone who is not able to prove citizenship under NRC is put in detention centres.
Reports of the violation of Human rights in these detention centres is alarming.

Source: A newborn died in a detention centre in Assam. Their mother was later found not to be a foreigner.


	(ii).	Loopholes and inconsistencies in the existing citizenship laws

There is a lot of speculation around cut off dates and proving of ancestry based on the pilot NRC launched in Assam but nothing concrete so far can be determined since the nation wide Bill hasn‚Äôt been drafted.

But one thing we know for sure - every person resident in India will be required to prove their citizenship.

How does one prove their citizenship?

This is where matters get complex.

If we don‚Äôt consider the speculated ancestry provision which may or may not be included in the nation wide NRC, The current law for citizenship is as follows -


The Citizenship Act defines a citizen as:

Section 3:

Citizenship by birth ‚Äî

(1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), every person born in India,‚Äî
(a) on or after the 26th day of January, 1950, but before the 1st day of July, 1987;

(b) on or after the 1st day of July, 1987, but before the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003 and either of whose parents is a citizen of India at the time of his birth;

(c) on or after the commencement of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2003, where‚Äî
(i) both of his parents are citizens of India; or
(ii) one of whose parents is a citizen of India and the other is not an illegal migrant at the time of his birth, 

shall be a citizen of India by birth.

Short of this is,

If you were born in India before 1987 but after 1950, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 1987 but before 2003 and either of your parents are Indian citizens, you are a citizen.

If you were born after 2003 and both your parents are Indian citizens or one of your parents is an Indian citizen and the other is not an illegal immigrant, you are a citizen.

So if you were born before 1987, you‚Äôre an Indian citizen by birth.

If you‚Äôre born after 1987 you have to prove that your parents are Indian citizens. (What about the orphans?)

How do you do it?

If you‚Äôre born before 1987, you can prove citizenship by provision of birth certificate or other documents as may be prescribed by the NRC.

Assuming your parents were educated and organised enough they would be able to preserve your birth certificate and other such documents but people from lower middle class or slightly under privileged backgrounds may not have done the same because they weren‚Äôt educated and informed enough about the importance of these documents. This leaves a person in a state of handicap.


If you‚Äôre born after 1987, considering that  almost 44% of India‚Äôs population is under  24 years of age and a total 85% of the population is under 54 years of age, we can safely conclude the above group constitutes a large chunk of India‚Äôs population.

You have to prove that at least one of your parents is an Indian citizen. So if you‚Äôre born after 1987 naturally your parents are born before 1987. You‚Äôll have to provide the necessary documents of YOUR PARENTS
to prove THEY‚ÄôRE Indian citizens. Basically they expect you to preserve and possess documents dating back to as much as the 1960‚Äôs.

Many news agencies are reporting that mere submitting of passports and Aadhar cards shall suffice and THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE.

Mere submitting of passports, birth certificate shall not suffice to prove citizenship, this was ruled by Bombay high court in 2013.
Source

In conclusion,
67% of our population is still rural as per the 2015 census. This coupled with inadequate infrastructure and lacking admin capacities to implement a nationwide program like this would be a disaster.

	(iii).	Why NRC promotes inequality against the Muslims?

Imagine a scenario where a nationwide NPR is rolled out. The babus administering the exercise mess up and end up sending a whole bunch of people  of all faiths a ‚Äúspecified proforma‚Äù from the register. 


Now, a legal recourse is available only to people of the six religions mentioned in the CAA. Do note that the law specifically says that people belonging to these faiths ‚Äúshall not be treated as illegal migrants"". Muslims, however, will not have any such recourse. For that matter, even Jews won‚Äôt be able to do anything about their exclusion from the register. 

As a result, lakhs and crores of excluded people might have to declare that they are illegal immigrants to become Indian citizens again.

The tricky part is proving religious  persecution in another country.

To benefit from the CAA, the person issued a specified proforma by the NPR must prove that, one, they are a non-Muslim migrant from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh, 

and, two, that they came to India to escape religious persecution. 

*(read with the point mentioned in CAA) But because the Government can make the rules under the Passport Act essentially at whim, the government can simply strike out the second condition and keep only the first.

	(iv).	Economic cost

The Global economy is on a slowdown and India is no exception to it, I generally never attribute GDP numbers with a Government since the only active participation of a Government in a GDP is via public expenditure which is still crucial. However, when a Government actively makes policies which are detrimental to the state of the economy, then fingers will be pointed.

This is the case with NRC.

 In Assam alone it cost 1220 crores - 1500 crores and ended up in a massive failure.
Source:
 
The national cost of implementing the NRC would run into lakhs of crores. With the Indian economy in its current situation, implementing NRC would surely leave a visible dent on the Indian economy. Especially when there is absence of any ROI (Return on Investment) from such a policy.

The estimated cost of this might be close to 2-3 lakh crores (unverified).

Source: This is an opinion piece and the figures may have the effect of being inflated or underestimated.

Say, it costs 3 lakh crores, it‚Äôs still just 1.57% of our last year‚Äôs GDP i.e. $2.72 Trillion.

However, just like Demonetisation this act will bring the country to a halt. People will have to line up yet again at verification centres, for document verification, follow ups & enquiries. 

In Assam, the NRC updating started on July 30, 2018 and ended on August 31, 2019 and despite taking over an year to complete this process, the entire process ended up in material inconsistencies and glaring errors.
Source:

A nation-wide implementation would cost years in loss of productivity and the economic cost of this practice would be dangerous.

Demonetisation caused the GDP growth to drop to 6.1%, though it recovered in the later quarters and consumption patterns stabilised too.
Source:.

Over 1.5 million jobs were lost in Q3 of FY 2016-17 post implementation of demonetisation.
Source CMIE report.

The nation wide implementation of NRC will have a similar or larger impact on the economy but this time it will come with a substantial human cost.

	(v).	Cost of Error

The NRC exercise would be highly prone to error‚Äîboth Type I and Type II. 

Explanation:

Type I errors:  False positives 

Mistakenly identifying a person as an immigrant from protected minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, and erroneously giving them the benefit of Indian citizenship. 

Immigrants are usually a net economic benefit; so the costs of Type I errors are only confined to national security. 

These costs are not nationwide and typically limited to a handful of border districts in India.


Type II errors: False negatives

These occur when those who qualify as Indian citizens are mistakenly categorized as illegal immigrants. A nationwide NRC, if similar to the one in Assam, would imply that false negatives get sent to detention centres or deported.

Type II errors are extremely costly. To minimize false negatives, the bar to qualify as a citizen has to be very simple and easily identifiable. 

Also, infrastructure to scrutinize the paperwork for the NRC has to be exceptionally efficient. 

The Indian state usually fails on both counts. Given the CAB‚Äôs current religious exclusionary basis, Muslims are at higher risk of exclusion through false negatives, though all groups, including Hindus, are likely to be affected by errors.


There are three main issues to consider here. 


The first is the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. 

If, to avoid false positives, the government has a high level of scrutiny for NRC inclusion, all individuals will have the burden of meeting this higher bar. In the process, some might be mistakenly excluded. 

On the other hand, if the bar is set very low to prevent false negatives and erroneous exclusions, then some illegal immigrants may slip through the cracks. 
The current CAB framework, combined with the NRC, is set up to minimize false positives, which will automatically increase false negatives.


The third issue is of the magnitude of error.

1) If Govt executes well with 5% error, 67.5 million people will be displaced (equalling displacement by WW II)

2) If it has Aadhaar error rate (8.8%) 120 million will be left out.

3) If it has 1% error, still 13.5 million Indians will be displaced (same as partition of India)

Both the source materials for the data above are opinion pieces since the numbers can only be estimated as of now and should be read accordingly.

There are a lot of narratives around the CAA and NRC but one thing that we need to stress on too is that illegal immigrants coming to India are disenfranchised and very poor. To blanket categorise them as some evil ‚Äúinfiltrators‚Äù stealing our lands and jobs is unfair and inhumane.","Thank you for making this. I was brought to tears when I finished watching this.

### Tl;dr

Access to good quality internet has never been more important than right now. With most experts unanimous on the need for ¬†social distancing and many workplaces putting into place work from home plans, voice and data connectivity become critical. To ensure that high quality bandwidth is available to all parts of India we have suggested specific steps to be taken by the Department of Telecom. 

### ""We the people..."", of the Internet

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Union Government is taking various policy measures to safeguard the health and welfare of all Indians as per an advisory by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare titled, ‚Äú*Advisory on Social Distancing Measure in view of spread of COVID-19 disease*‚Äù ([**link**](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf)). Point number 3 to this advisory recommends to, ‚Äú*Encourage private sector organizations/employers to allow employees to work from home wherever feasible.*‚Äù A ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù measure is critical during this time to contain adverse economic impacts on individuals, companies and the entire Indian economy.

At the same time during this period many people are likely to undergo mental stress and will reach out to loved ones for comfort and support. Even for children, remote educational modes of learning will become vital at this time as schools are closed. Many such interests which require social distancing necessary to restrict the spread of Covid-19 are supported by the availability of telecom and data services. However, as is the case with such a measure we would like to highlight that there comes certain network capacity related risks which policymakers must respond to. 

A recent report in the New York Times, dated March 16, 2020 informs us that a work and learn from home set up, leads to considerable stress on underlying network infrastructure ([**link**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/technology/coronavirus-working-from-home-internet.html)). This is because last mile home service networks are designed to handle traffic patterns which are considerably different to enterprise grade internet broadband networks. Moreover, Wi-Fi based home internet systems have their own set of challenges in terms of reliability and quality of service. 

### We need to have a plan to support each other

We urge for crucial policy measures by putting forth a comprehensive plan in coordination with appropriate government departments and ministries. We specifically suggest the following:

1. **Periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure** **constraints:** There is an urgent need for the DOT and TRAI to conduct assessments in consultation with large telecom and internet service providers on the capacity to carry voice and internet traffic. Separately, there's a need for authorities to engage with representatives from internet users both enterprise facing stakeholders and consumer facing stakeholders in challenges they may face in continuing their day to day activities online. All of these actions must nonetheless, uphold the spirit of net neutrality and not lead to discriminatory treatment of internet traffic.
2. **Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies:** We recommend that a voluntary pledge may be encouraged by the Union Government in which telecom and internet service providers decide to not terminate services of any residential or small business users because of their inability to pay their bills due to disruptions caused specifically by COVID-19. 
3. **Ensure full and complete access at all times:** We urge that an advisory may be issued to all State Governments to halt any internet shutdowns or actions under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017 which are likely to increase hardship for people and organisations. This includes measures which slow down internet access speeds since that has the potential cripple economic activities.

We urge people from across the community (especially technical experts and small businesses) on if they have experienced any difficulties whilst accessing the internet, or using voice and video conferencing services. IFF will remain alert to the situation should it develop.

f3t8ip,ThyDoppelganger,Policy/Economy,"How I see the Pulwama Attacks, Abridged","So an year ago, there was some intelligence input that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. Naturally, they relayed the information over to our honourable Prime Minister the Great Narendra Modi. Now our beautiful Modi was so preoccupied with thinking out policies for the then Budget to boost our economy that he did not pay attention to it. Those stupid intelligence officers should have found a better time to inform our marvellous Modi, like, say, after February 14th.

Anyways, the CRPF men were planning to go to Srinagar from Jammu. Our fantastic Modi told them to take 78 vehicles so that the people would not miss the glory that is the Indian Army. Some fools raised possible security threat in going in a conspicuous 78 vehicle convoy. How dare they?! Shouldn't the people of India, especially those antinationalistic Kashmiris, see the glory of our Hindu nation?

Anyways, while they were moving, a car laden with explosives rammed into one of the vehicles, and the resulting blast killed 40 of our brave CRPF men. This act of terrorism irked our magnificient Modi, who meditated to let their souls rest in peace. During this meditation, Modi got a divine message. ""Those putrid Pakistanis committed this act. We must punish them."" Now this was divine, because even after a year, the NIA still has no clue where the bomb came from, while Modi understood it in a fraction of a second.

Anyways, our divine Modi swore revenge on the damned Pakistanis, and sent our brave Indian Army to Balakot to kill them. Our Indian Army dropped bombs there, killing several Pakistani terrorists. This was a very valiant move. I heard that a soldier was so brave that he gained the Vir Chakra for bravely getting his plane shot down and getting caught.

Anyways, the attack was a success. Exactly 420 terrorists died, including 256 antinational bacteria, 69 anti-Hindu fungi, 42 anti-Indian ferns, 31 anti-democratic trees, 13 Congress lizards, and 9 Muslim Crows. The satellite image in this [Reuters article](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pakistan-airstrike-insi/satellite-images-show-madrasa-buildings-still-standing-at-scene-of-indian-bombing-idINKCN1QN02Z) should show all casualities. If you don't see all of them, including the bacteria, that means you're antinational. Get wrecked by NRC, you filthy Non-Bhakt.

Anyways, the intelligent people of India realised that our excellent Modi should rule India for decades to come. They saw that under our admirable Modi, we can regain the glory of our Vedic age, where there were satellites, where people used the internet, where people had nuke-laden arrows, where divine cows cure cancer, where women were trophies to be placed rightfully in kitchens, where we were proud of our caste system, where Dalits knew their place, where there were no Muslims and hence no terrorists, where kingship was hereditary; wait no, kingship can't be hereditary otherwise we'd be no different from those crazy Congressmen and even crazier Congresswomen, to say nothing of Congress-transgenders. So the Vedic age wasn't perfect, after all. Huh. You learn new things every day.

Anyways, this is my belief of what really happened in Pulwama. Hindustan zindabad.

Dorsey said ‚Äúwe have policies around violent extremist groups,‚Äù but did not give a straightforward answer to the question. Dorsey did not respond to two requests for comment sent via Twitter DM.

>The argument that external experts made to Motherboard aligns with what the Twitter employee aired: Society as a whole uncontroversially and unequivocally demanded that Twitter take action against ISIS in the wake of beheading videos spreading far and wide on the platform. The automated approach that Twitter took to eradicating ISIS was successful: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen a legit ISIS supporter on Twitter who lasts longer than 15 seconds for two-and-a-half years,‚Äù Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Motherboard in a phone call.

The aftermath of the Delhi pogroms looks just as grim as the riots,  the only good thing being the absence of blood bath.

Twitter's inaction on these accounts makes me more worried. Twitter is excessively used to promote nazi like ideology here in India. Many of these campaigns are paid and Twitter is also a beneficiary of these campaigns.

ex24ov,Crantankerous,Policy/Economy,Quick Explainer on how to actually read and understand the Budget and Economic Survey,"Before the deluge of talking heads and op-eds overwhelm you with their thoughts, here's a rough guide to independently understand 
what the budget and Economic Survey are saying. Source: am research scholar in Economics. 

1. Listen to the whole budget speech or read the transcript online (usually available on a ministry website after a few hours). Dealing directly with the budget speech is the best way not to be swayed by random claims.

2. Filter through the hawa-baazi. A good chunk of the budget speech will be dedicated to singing the government's praises. Ignore all of that; the budget is as much a political speech as it is an economic one.  Do make a note of what they claim to have done though, in order to cross-check later. 

3. Most crucially, listen to how they intend to fund any new schemes. Are they going to increase taxes? Will they just give out loans via PSBs? Do they hope to draw on CSR resources? Will they divert funds from existing schemes?  There are typically two parts to the budget speech: Part A and Part B. Part A is mostly what they intend to do, Part B is mostly about how they intend to raise the funds for it; i.e. the taxation tweaks. Part B in my opinion is more important, as the how of these schemes is as important as the why. 

4. Listen to multiple commentary sources. Big business interests will obviously praise any budget that makes their life easier, and will also obviously praise the government in general to facilitate easy business. Thus: question anything that they say without highlighting specific plus points. The same applies to government critics, professors etc: They (myself included) have biases that lend themselves to automatically assuming the worst of any decision made. 

5. Don't overhype the budget. Between data manipulation and upcoming elections, the budget is no longer the significant economic blueprint that it once was. The same applies to the Economic Survey. It is important, but no longer sufficient to gauge the direction of the economy and the government's economic policies.",Thnku so much üôÇ ,/r/india/comments/ex24ov/quick_explainer_on_how_to_actually_read_and/
faprl4,InternetFreedomIn,Policy/Economy,Essential features of a rights respecting Data Protection Law,"https://preview.redd.it/w3igtx7vnlj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d61bc619966e39747319b263d1e649d649382a

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users‚Äô experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India‚Äôs data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India‚Äôs data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon‚Äôble Supreme Court‚Äôs decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union‚Äôs (EU‚Äôs) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1. ¬† ¬†Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as ‚Äúsignificant data fiduciaries‚Äù to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.* ¬† *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India‚Äôs Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.* ¬† *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4. ¬† Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn‚Äôt reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.* ¬† *The ‚Äúreasonable purposes‚Äù exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the ‚Äú**reasonable purposes**‚Äù category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people‚Äôs privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.

ee6xey,wricker,Policy/Economy,"Anti-national, who me? Anti-""Hindu-Nation""-al, certainly!","**The goal of** ***Hindutva*** **is the religious conversion of India.**

Call me a pessimist, but I believe that the BJP is actually benefiting from the CAA+NRC protests. Call me paranoid, but I think that Modi and Shah will use the chaos in the nation to justify even more fascist measures.

Fascism relies on the dichotomy of ‚Äòus and them‚Äô. ‚ÄòWe‚Äô, the caste Hindus, led by a strong patriarch, versus the Muslims (who are really Pakistani infiltrators and/or terrorists; dirty, conniving sub-humans who want to destroy Hindustan) and the Christians (a lot of them Dalits, who ‚Äòbelong‚Äô to Hindus but are taking away Hindu college seats and jobs, leading the country to shit, while they should be cleaning our shit).

This is *Hindutva*: hatred and ignorance masquerading as a political philosophy. Not socialism, social democracy, liberalism or conservatism, but hate. These philosophies, whatever their merits or demerits may be, take effort and dedication and love of the subject to study. Hindutva requires only hate. Forget Hindu texts, they don‚Äôt even have to study the Constitution. Doing so takes effort, you see. Hating and lynching is far easier.

This is why saffron-toting goons stop Muslims (and in [one unforgettable instance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJfvp59Kufs), Kanhaiya Kumar) and force them to chant ‚ÄúJai Shree Ram‚Äù; this is why Amit Shah dehumanizes Bangladeshi migrants to ‚Äútermites‚Äù; why Narendra Modi says the protesters can be recognized from their clothes.

Why abrogation of Article 370, why the blackout and human rights violations in Kashmir, why the abnormal Modia focus on Pakistan, why Ram Mandir, why NRC, why CAA? The message is clear: Muslims are not Indians, and they cannot stay. India is a Hindu Rashtra.

*But what about our Preamble? What happened to ‚Äòsovereign socialist secular democratic republic‚Äô? What of Article 14, Article 15? Our Fundamental Rights?*

Okay, maybe we aren‚Äôt ‚Äòsocialist‚Äô or ‚Äòsecular‚Äô anymore. But from a young age we have been reading and hearing these words. ‚ÄúUnity in diversity.‚Äù ‚ÄúUnited we stand, divided we fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndia is the world‚Äôs largest democracy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are a secular country.‚Äù ‚ÄúIndians are known for their hospitality.‚Äù

From our youth, the Idea of India is ingrained in us. And Hindutva -- hatred, really -- has attacked the very core of Indian-ness.

The fight today is not because we don‚Äôt want persecuted religious minorities to seek haven in India. That‚Äôs absurd. We are a very hospitable people.

We fight because 14 percent of Indians face religious persecution in their own country. We fight because the economy is going down and hatred is on the rise, and the ruling party has done nothing to fix either. Instead they are trying to alienate crores of Indians, making detention centres where at least [25 people have already died](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/25-declared-foreigners-died-in-assam-detention-centre-750773.html) (as of 31 Jul ‚Äô19), and set the police and armed forces on peaceful protesters leading to the death of at least 20 people (as of 22 Dec ‚Äô19). Their fantasy project will cost us [lakhs of crores](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlTKGz-TvJk) (to pay for NRC, CAA and detention centres). And if 20 people have died in the 18 initial days of the protests, we may be looking at hundreds, or even thousands of deaths within the next year alone.

If you think what BJP is doing is for the good of the nation, then we disagree on the definition of ‚Äògood‚Äô.

And we certainly disagree on the definition of a ‚Äònation‚Äô. Hindu Rashtra and Hindu nationalism violate the Constitution. And turning India into a theocracy like Iran is what Modi and Shah and the Sangh Parivar machinery wants to do. Can Modi say under oath that he does not want to convert India into Hindu Rashtra? Can the bhakts say so?

&#x200B;

**Fascism creates the conditions through which it can justify its own fascist policies.**

Religious conversion of India will require imposing tighter restrictions, and more fascist policies. And how does one justify the use of fascist policies?

An enemy.

While the protests have been going on, Indian and Pakistani firing across the border has increased (which was on the rise since the abrogation of 370). On [18 Dec](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/situation-along-loc-can-escalate-any-time-army-chief-bipin-rawat/articleshow/72872824.cms), Bipin Rawat issued a very provocative statement about ‚Äúescalatory matrix‚Äù. On [19 Dec](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/12/letter-pakistan-india-placing-missiles-kashmir-191219101643065.html), the Pakistani Foreign Minister wrote to UN alleging India had positioned missile-launchers in Kashmir, and the Indian government refused to comment (*a* *great way to defuse tensions /s*). Then Imran Khan on [Dec 21](https://www.dawn.com/news/1523532/pakistan-will-give-befitting-response-if-india-undertakes-false-flag-operation-pm-imran) replied with such terms as ‚Äúbloodbath‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse flag operations‚Äù. And today ([22 Dec](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-rajouri-poonch/article30371876.ece)) morning there were major firing and shelling from both sides on multiple places: Pakistan [reports](https://thesouthern.com/news/world/pakistan-says-indian-shooting-kills-in-kashmir/article_e76017d4-78f9-5481-92c9-1a147f352159.html) three civilians killed with a dozen homes damaged, while India says our soldiers ‚Äúretaliated effectively‚Äù.

Funnily enough, no talk of surgical strikes is floating around. Perhaps this time they do not serve Modi Ji‚Äôs purpose. Or perhaps there are no clouds in the sky? In any case, this time the purpose will perhaps be served by sacrificing our soldiers in a direct conflict. Against the Muslim-majority Pakistan.

And oh, the protesters who can be recognized by their clothes? Clearly they are Pakistani infiltrators and terrorists. The protesting students? *Tukde-tukde* gang. The professors, academicians and journalists? Anti-nationals and urban Naxals. International critics? They carry the ""white man's burden"" if they're white, and are inconsequential if they're of any other colour.

Fascism, elected democratically, will destroy democracy. Say your final ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù on WhatsApp.

In Nazi Germany, Jews were portrayed as dirty ‚Äòrats‚Äô (well, at least a mammal, not insects) who were lazy, stupid and cunning and stole the hard-working Germans‚Äô jobs (see the contradictions?). In fact, Jews were on average well-educated and held important positions and ran businesses due to their hard work. Then through fascist policies, inch-by-inch, Nazis made the conditions unbearable for Jews, so that they really had to lose their jobs, their homes, had to live in squalor, and some started committing petty crimes to feed themselves. ‚ÄúSee!‚Äù said the Nazis, ‚Äúwe told you they were cunning criminal rats!‚Äù

Thus they justified the Holocaust.

Justifying a holocaust is not that hard. We Indians are living that process of justification right now. Not so long ago, Islamophobia was frowned upon or at least hidden, and ‚Äúanti-nationals‚Äù and ‚Äúurban Naxals‚Äù were merely juvenile name-calling to be shrugged off (not so much for Gauri Lankesh). By creating the conditions, Modi is making these words into serious accusations, which will help him bring into effect more fascist policies, and then the Constitution will be re-written. The *ghar wapsi* of India will be complete.

We can at least make the process of justifying the holocaust hard for him. By calling out fake news, boycotting Modia, boycotting companies which support and finance BJP (you-know-who), and above all, by using non-violent means of protest. Y‚Äôknow, protesting Indian-style.

*Ahimsa* is the word I believe.","Only the region around Kolkata was industrialized. North and east Bengal were not. Most Bengalis were poor. The people who became Brahmos were lower castes. The people who joined Jugantar and Anushilan Samiti were poor. Bengali nationalism was a phenomenon of the masses. The ""Bengali internationalists"" who were opposed to Bengali nationalism, like the Tagore family, were rich and influential.

Edit: it is true that Bengal was one of the richest and most industrialized regions, but to think that GDP and degree of industrialization translates to riches of the common people is a logical fallacy ",/r/india/comments/ee6xey/antinational_who_me_antihindunational_certainly/
ed1ehe,vardhan68,Policy/Economy,The problem with BJP supporters,"Okay, so this is my first ever post on reddit. I have been a keen observer of Indian politics since the last 6 years. I was a voter who voted for BJP in good faith thinking that they are different from other parties. But since the last few years my view point has completely changed. But this post won't discuss about the actions of BJP that led to the change in my political stance, but this would rather be a post about what is the real problem with the BJP supporters. 

I might be wrong here but here are some of my observations from my personal experience. 

1.) BJP fans simply don't understand that you can simultaneously oppose two political parties. As soon as you start debating them on a certain issue, they will straight away associate you with congress, communists or even with a terrorist. They believe that every one who is against BJP has joined a faction. 

2.) Staunch BJP fans certainly don't realize that a person isn't against the nation if they are against BJP.  They just rebrand you anti national even if you ask logical questions on government policies. These people are forgetting that we have every right to question the government and protest if we don't think something is right. That is what distinguishes us from a country like North Korea or Saudi Arabia. We do not have a king, rather we have a prime minister who is responsible for answering us. 

3.) BJP supporters tend to discredit each and every source which criticizes the government. These people are just not ready to accept the fact that someone who is not affiliated to any political party can criticize the government. If a post or a newspaper article condemns the government, they simply start calling it anti Indian or congress sponsored propaganda. 

4.) BJP supporters also use a tool called Whataboutism. They justify their wrongdoing by referring to the wrongdoing of other parties. For example, okay BJP is corrupt but what about congress it was more corrupt. But they do not understand that this does not change the fact that even BJP is corrupt, and if you are trying to bring positive changes you cannot repeat the same mistakes that your predecessors have made. 

5.) BJP supporters can't accept the fact that a person can do both constructive and destructive work. I agree that BJP has also brought in some positive changes, but that doesn't justify its wrongdoing. You can appreciate and criticize a person at the same time. Just because you have voted for them shouldn't make them immune to your criticism. You chose them to represent you, you have every right to criticize their actions and appreciate any good work. 

6.) Even if they can clearly see that BJP is playing communal politics, they will turn a blind eye to it. They say congress played a dirtier one, again whataboutism at its best. Congress played communal politics, that is the reason you voted against them. But if the new party also starts doing the same how can you support them only on the basis of your vote.  

7.) As soon as a communal card is played like mandir the BJP fans will always deviate from real issues like economy, poverty, economic reforms, business investments. Their first priority will become to resolve that petty issue rather than the real ones. 


So my thoughts on this issue is that in this day and age we are still fighting for the issues that the British wanted us to fight on. Religion, once upon a time it was used to unite people but right now it is only playing a divisive role. We as the modern generation have to stop taking pride in our religion and just not get emotional while voting on the basis of your religion. It does not matter whatever degree you have because if you caste your votes on the basis of just being from a particular religion then the value of getting that education goes to zero. Don't let social media dictate your perspective, do your own research and make your own mindset rather than following the mindset of the crowd. 

I would seriously like you guys to give your insight on this post. Thank you.","Critical thinking is against all societal norm everywhere, so we are taught to say yes to all the elders, parents, bosses. ",/r/india/comments/ed1ehe/the_problem_with_bjp_supporters/
ekjgwb,agnjataupayoktavu,Policy/Economy,You. Yes!!! It's You. Do it.,"It's high time already! It's so bad that a lurker has to post this. Have always been one, so as to never degrade the content quality of the sub. But, assessing the current political situation has made me impromptu promptly write this.
I'm not here to be a keyboard warrior by bashing the fascist leader and gain karma out of it.
Instead, I'll lay down a plan to tackle the current regime. It only deals with their propaganda power since it has time and again proven that propaganda plays a major role in convincing people to support or commit atrocities. This is the pillar that provides support to the oncoming fascism. Let's BREAK them into pieces. 

1) Since, lack of karma has refrained me from writing things in other subs. As a sound citizen, we need you to get our situation to be heard globally (like the HongKong protest). Henceforth, Fella redditors with high karma and eloquent writing skills. Do post articles, videos, engage in group discussions happening in global subs like world news, Politics and many more. Subs that has their presence in the front page.
Use your meme knowledge, post and repost memes to subs like memes, dank meme, meme economy and so on.

2) WhatsApp is the breeding ground for BJP propaganda. Inorder to counter this, we need you to post videos highlighting the hypocrisy of this party. Especially the ones that OFFICIAL PEEING HUMAN uploads. Tweet him asking for an offline download link of his vidoes. Or do download it by illegal means ( anything illegal for greater good is good).
Do not post link to the videos. Mid-life crisis unkills and aunties won't open the link and watch it. Even if they did, not gonna watch more than 5 seconds. They are brainwashed in thinking Modi is the superman that's gonna save their arse from monotonous life. Do not send them to a liberal's den. They identify themselves as Bhakt due to the sheer propaganda and will refute to believe any of it. Hence, remove the doctrine slowly. Administer the truth little by little in their silly heads. Truth is, if they can be brainwashed to an extend that can support this regime without giving any batshit about the trend of the country. They can be rewired to think in the right way as well. Sharing offline videos in WhatsApp groups will definitely make them watch it accidentally atleat once. Since, they are prone to clicking it on their Phone Gallery.  Apparently,most of them don't care to even delete it later.

You will obviously face criticism from your family, friends and acquaintances by sharing the videos in their WhatsApp Group. Calm your nerves down. Do not engage in a rebuttal with them. Keep posting every hour every day. Things will change. People who blindly supported the party's claims will progressively begin to think about it. They may not change their stand an overnight, a week, a month or forever. But will definitely cross think about the situation. And will not start shouting slogans praising this fascist regime.
Do add photos and videos highlighting great leaders,celebrities,experts of any field expressing their opinions. Do quote Golden words said by past leaders and dictators regarding the fascism.
Share pictures of scientific data and statistics highlighting the economic growth, unemployment     trend and so on. 

Might seem like a silly thing to do. But things like these are definitely the ones that pulled them in supporting BJP in the first place.

3) Eloquent writers of this sub. Please Write messages that serves like a WhatsApp forward messages. (You know, like the share with five groups to charge your smartphone to 100%)
Mods, please make an active thread on it. Allow us to copy and share it in the other online medias.
Use your wit and style, to enhance the power of the message. 

DO NOT LABEL an ignorant or a brainwashed mind as a bhakt or sanghi. I trusted Modi by the party's propaganda thinking they did good for the nation. Unlike the mainstream propaganda, I fell prey to the pretentious Quoran who bags the number one place in followers count. He sold lies without telling lies. He never lied about the policy and regulations government made. Instead, he bent and twisted the facts in favour of the party. He sold hopes after every failure of the government's action. He's a prime example of an educated moron. He highlights the fact that an educated mind is not equivalent as an intellect's mind.
Sorry it turned into a rant.
Wanted y'all to know,how a budding mind like mine fell to his black magic. His educational credentials is what makes growing and educated minds fall for such propaganda trap. If I hadn't stumbled upon this platform, I would've remained a Bhakth even now. 

Change starts from your home. Don't involve in a verbal abuse or quarrel with your hardcore right wing conservative family,if they are one. Instead, keep mumbling about the country's situation then and now like a casual talk.
Let their mind process it.
Educate them about history like How Hitler rose to power and how our country is trying to be the 1930's Germany.

Unlike the Nazi's  who had control over the media back then i.e the newspapers and Radio which was and is only one-sided where the true mind couldn't express the truth. Our generation is blessed enough to have countless online presence and mode of communication is much easier and two sided.

Brainwash the minds into thinking right.

Do not outcast them into a different sect. This will only create chaos. Their sadness will be disguised in the form anger. This will make them loathe our ideologies and ultimately send them into the deep pit of what propaganda machines dug.

Rather,listen to their side and make them understand. I don't know how many of the downvoted answers/ comments were genuinely by people who just needed to hear the other side of the story aka the true and filtered one.
If they are hell bent on being a bhakth,just ignore them. 

You know,brain is a fragile thing. It's shaped by the things that it's surround itself with.

4) Post Documentaries, articles, paragraphs from well renowned books about our world history or anything that seems relevant to the current cause

Fellow redditors be ready to smash the upvote buttons in sending them to the front page. 

It's far-off better than highlighting tweets or images that creates only segregation in the society.

Let's walk the path of Ahimsa and Truth.

""In a gentle way, you can shake the world.""
""Whenever you are confronted with an opponent, conquer him with love.""- M.K Gandhiji

""Peace  cannot be built on exclusivism, absolutism, and intolerance. But neither can it be built on vague liberal slogans and pious programs gestated in the smoke of confabulation. There can be no peace on earth without the kind of inner change that brings man back to his 'right mind'.""



LET'S DO IT. LET'S EDUCATE THEM.","Don't give in easily. People who boast about caste and class are souls who have no identity left in their life. Being a part of such cult is what gives them a reason to exist. That's their identity. Without such things, they themselves are sure about not having a zeal or cause in life.
But our mission is to educate the kids or growing minds in not falling to such delusion.
I'm an atheist, although I have a staunchly religion following family. Knowledge liberated me. And it is my identity. I've tried and partly convinced close ones around me in thinking about the hypocrisy of religion.
How?

ekxrig,fekumama,Policy/Economy,Hear me out. This might be a rant. Maybe this government doesn't care about the people at all. Maybe we deserve this government as we did not vote them out in the last elections. Maybe this would be a lesson to future voters on whom not to vote.,"The way the leaders of this government are behaving, it is quite clear they have their heads buried so up in their own asses, they are totally oblivious of the ground realities. By the time people were yet to come out of Article 370 removal and Babri Masjid verdict, the government went ahead and implemented CAA. These guys are so good at creating new fires even before the embers of old flames have died down. They are not even giving time to the civil society to catch a breath.

Seriously attacking students and then condemning the attacks for namesake as if people wouldn't know who was behind these cowardly attacks. They have literally come to a conclusion that public is stupid, they will believe whatever our we spin it in the media. Gautam gambhir could have visited the university, hell nirmala sitharam is an Alumni of the same University. Is anyone even ready to take moral responsibility for these attacks?

I am pretty sure the party in power is almost ready to unleash their next half baked policy on our people and we will have to start protesting against that. Damn these are going to be 4 more very long years. By then the economy will be gone to dogs and if anybody questions anything there will always be the Pakistan rhetoric.",Lookout for fsdr or frdi.

ecr1tb,hsnaras,Policy/Economy,Moderate rightists vs extremist Savarkarites,"I'd identify myself as a centrist with a left inclination. I swing both directions on economic and social issues, but am strongly liberal and progressive on civil liberties. If someone labels me leftist, i would say - not entirely true, but sometimes I'm pretty leftist. With being labeled socialist, I would disagree more assertively, citing my strong inclinations towards a healthy mixed economy and market driven solutions to socio-economic problems. But if I was to be labeled Communist or Naxalite, I would vehemently disagree. I'm sure there are some overlaps between these ideologies and mine, but that way I'll have some overlaps with almost all ideologies in the world. So there's a spectrum on the left side of politics, which is well understood widely. Like me, most leftists don't identify with being communist or naxalite.

Now, right of centre politics, which is having a bit of a peak moment globally at the moment, is bound to have similar diversity and differentiation. But this differentiation is not as well understood, perhaps because Indian right has not been as dominant historically as it has been lately, so people haven't caught up yet. In case of the Modi-Shah government, a lot of people voted for them in the 2014 general elections because of the anti-corruption and development narrative they campaigned with, and because of the national security issue which peaked following Pulwama attack and Balakot airstrikes. These people may be supporters of market-driven economic reforms, may want a break from the status quo of structural corruption in the Indian state, may aspire towards a more assertive foreign policy and may desire a more proactive law and order regime. These are issues which many pragmatic liberals and leftists would also support. I, myself support many of this government's foreign, security and environmental policies. Can't say the same for this government's economic policies and civil liberties record. Anyone who doesn't see the plight of the Indian economy is delusional.

Coming back to the topic, most of the BJP voters may not support the RSS agenda or consider Modi an avatar of Vishnu. But nonetheless, in the everyday online discourse, anyone supporting Modi or government's policy is labeled as Modi-cultist (b word) or belonging to RSS (s word). These terms have been misused so much that they have become meaningless. (But at least  they are not as obscene as the terms that the right uses against left) This distinction between moderates and extremists on the right needs to be acknowledged and understood. The extremists on the Indian right subscribe to the Savarkarite ideology of radical majoritarian nationalism, which they try to link with Hinduism, by calling it Hindutva. The extremist Savarkarites are the ones who indulge in conspiracy theories of global islamic takeover, and that 'sab mile hue hain' - students, congress, aap, muslims, bollywood, global media (even Pak and Dawood). They act as if questioning our own government in a democracy is a crime. These Savarkarites are violently anti-Gandhian, so they are ready to justify any means, as long as the ends are as per their ideology. They are ok with democratic institutions being destroyed so that their leader wins,  hundreds dying because of demonetisation, regular Kashmiris suffering because of some extremist elements, innocent students being shot at because of vandalism done by others, and so on.

This extremist faction of the right is the real danger to our nation, and to whom most liberal leftists are strongly opposed. These Savarkarites interpret the BJP manadate to mean that majority of the country supports their extremists views of establishment of Hindu Rashtra, demonization of Muslims and one-party state in India. They forget that 65 % of Indians didn't vote for BJP, and even among the 35% that did,  many don't support their extremist agenda. These spontaneous, peaceful protests by lakhs of students in every single part of the country has proven that these Savarkarites are delusional. India is strongly pluralistic and will vehemently oppose the bigoted agenda that they subscribe to. And these lakhs of protestors are more opposed to violence than these extremist Savarkarites, and are heart-broken when some miscreants turn towards violence. Violent and extremist elements on both sides should be punished by the due process of law. Jai Hind!

P.S: Those who see the world only through one lens will wonder if I'm a muslim. I was born a Hindu, but no longer identify with any religion. I'm a proud Indian though.","I don't know **that** much about the motivations of the RSS, I haven't read enough.

But yes, the writings and ideology of Hegdewar and Gowalkar are said be quite influential. Hegdewar himself was influenced by Savarkar and his writing though, so there is overlap between the two as well. 

The fundamental difference is the religious aspect imo. The RSS believes in a ""Hindu Rashtra"" as in a nation for all Hindus and no one else whereas this wasn't case for Savarkar at all.

I think that is a difference stark enough to warrant a distinction, hence my original comment. ",/r/india/comments/ecr1tb/moderate_rightists_vs_extremist_savarkarites/
elxn3v,Monsultant,Policy/Economy,Blind boomer analogy in India - We are the real boomers,"With the ""OK Boomer"" memes becoming popular, I've noticed a lot of Indians blindly picking up American boomer arguments and using it in Indian context. The arguments go something to the tune of - you had the best of times, the best jobs, social security, economic growth and are now becoming an impediment to education subsidies and liberal policies that will benefit the present youth.

In the Indian context, these arguments are only partially true. Firstly, the word boomer refers to baby boomers generation born post WW-II (1946-1964). This was the period where the great health-care became accessible to everyone in developed nations and the child mortality dropped fast. However, the birth-rates remained relatively high (though decreasing) and this led to high number of kids being born. This was the golden period of American growth - women and boomers then joined labor force and there was a great productivity rise in labor. Middle-class grew and moved to sub-urbs and could live that idylic existence with benefits of big cities as well as countryside. Boomers led a positive existence - not just that, because the birth-rates decreased subsequently, boomers also had disproportionate power as a voting block (which was bolstered by the fact that the voting % in boomers is much higher than in subsequent generations too). So, they could bring about and keep laws which were in line with their values but were old-fashioned according to their successors. Moreover, older people living on savings hate increase in inflation that comes with debt-fueled government spendings. So, it was natural for this generation to be debt hawks which also meant opposition to subsidies which led to rise in education debt amongst younger generation.Hence, it is a legitimate cause of angst for politically savvy young people who are forced to live in a society controlled by the oldies who support arcane laws (against abortion for instance) and go against their benefits (education subsidies).

However, India has a completely different demographic profile. Purely, in terms of being the largest generation, we are the boomers of India. We were born around or just before the high growth post-liberalization India, have opportunities (in terms of private sector jobs, access to information) that the older generation did not have (boomers had booming economy whereas their parents had depression and war). Even as a political block, the young people have the biggest electoral power amongst all generations (a power that was partially harnessed by BJP when they won two elections). Moreover, with the dropping birth-rates in India, we would also grow old in an era of depressed population growth where we continue to be the most influential generation - just like the boomers!

However, it is also true that the older generation is more bigoted, religiously/caste-wise minded than us and have a role in morally bankrupt polity in this country. There is some blame that we can certainly lay on the older generation. But, the whole boomer spiel of the west wherein the millennial generation claims that the boomers had a much better life and are now actively spoiling the present and future of current youth is certainly not applicable here. Our parents' generation had a life of scarcity in terms of resources and opportunities. Even if you are not interested in reading history or talking to your parents, just watch movies - heroes or characters who were struggling to find work, were getting rejected because they could not pay bribes were part of every story. Apart from government jobs, any city apart from tier-I had little to no opportunities in the license-raj era. Statistically, there was lower economic growth and more poverty.

To see the claims about the older generation led a great life is ridiculous. However, it is true that the young need to break free of the religious and caste fundamentalism that the older generation were a victim of due to their lack of exposure and programming.","> Look at the average income of people in India.

czvagp,firasd,Policy/Economy,I transcribed the full text of Dr. Manmohan Singh's remarks on economic mismanagement by the current government in India,"*Transcript of the remarks by India‚Äôs former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, about economic mismanagement under the Modi government. Sept 1 2019.*

The state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter‚Äôs GDP growth rate of 5 percent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate, but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slowdown.

It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is tottering at 0.6 percent. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. Domestic demand is depressed. And consumption growth is at an 18 month low. Nominal GDP growth is at 15 year low.

There is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded, and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiment are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recovery.

The Modi government‚Äôs policies are resulted in massive jobless growth. More than 3.5 lakh Jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting our most vulnerable workers.

Rural India is in terrible shape. Our farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined. The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their income, by inflicting misery on over 50 percent of India‚Äôs population.

Institutions are under attack, and their autonomy is being eroded. The resilience of the Reserve Bank will be tested after its record transfer of rupees 1.76 lakh crore to the government, which claims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall. In addition, the credibility of India‚Äôs data has come under question under this government.

Budget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase the exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignment. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government.

Our youth, our farmers and our farm workers, entrepreneurs, and the marginalised section deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the Government to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.",Me too ,/r/india/comments/czvagp/i_transcribed_the_full_text_of_dr_manmohan_singhs/
f2mvuh,InternetFreedomIn,Policy/Economy,Workplace Surveillance: Your employer could be watching you,"### 

https://preview.redd.it/7mv86kazrfg41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f2d2839802afc223f409a31c337514b1e33c9b

### Tl;dr

IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.

### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss

Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 

### Recommendations 

In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.

1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.

### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC

For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

If you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in. We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill.

Do people not understand that the majority of these ""funds"" will be spent on stock buybacks and higher bonuses? There are clear and abundant examples of what happens around the world when corp tax rates are decreased without a simultaneous effort to tackle the underlying problems of a stuttering economy.

Basic economic policy will tell you that in economies with deman side issues, an income tax cut will have far better and far more extensive implications that a corp tax cut.

edwj5r,LovableDistributor,Policy/Economy,Is this the future?," Sumit was adjusting his position in the bus, sweating in the heat. He saw his friend Shweta shift beside him. They were just returning from their official trip from Mumbai, back to Delhi. The bus had picked them up from the airport. 

Sumit was explaining to Shweta about how good the movie was. While he was explaining, he was simultaneously watching the road. He had a view of the road ahead. He spotted two SUVs parked across the road, as if to block it. He saw half a dozen people standing in front of it. His heart skipped a beat.

His body stiffened, and Shweta felt it. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù she asked

‚ÄúNothing, just give me a minute‚Äù he said

He kept looking around and found a seat beside another girl in the back. He immediately got up.

‚ÄúYou should move there‚Äù he said, pointing at the empty seat.

‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre just acting weird now. Why should I move?‚Äù she asked in a high pitch

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask questions, please! Just go there!‚Äù he said as he grabbed her hand and almost forcefully lead her to the seat. He only had a moment to look at her face and he felt bad.

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll explain everything later. Just don‚Äôt worry. Sit tight and you‚Äôll be fine‚Äù he said

She pulled him back, standing midway between the seat they were sitting in and the seat he had chosen. They felt the bus slow down further, she had to hold on to the rails on the ceiling. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere until you tell me what‚Äôs going on!‚Äù she hissed

Sumit looked around, and while some were staring at what was soon appearing to be a mob blocking the road, some were staring at them. Sumit figured he still had some seconds before they got in. He grabbed her hand and took her to the seat they had been sitting in.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time. But this is the issue. I‚Äôm circumcised. They look like RSS mobs and they normally check the guys for this. If they see that you‚Äôre with me, they‚Äôll assume you are a muslim too. I‚Äôll manage, it‚Äôs okay‚Äù he whispered to her. 

Shweta took a few moments to register what she just heard, while she saw Sumit‚Äôs face turn scarlet. They were good friends, but this was a detail about that she didn‚Äôt know if she wanted to hear. 

‚ÄúShweta, just go!‚Äù he hissed, but at the same time wondering what she was thinking

‚ÄúNo, why should I leave you to fend for yourself? Please, I‚Äôll tell them that you‚Äôre with me. That you‚Äôre my family. They--‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, they are going to check all the men anyway. There‚Äôs no point‚Äù he interrupted her.

They heard voices, and he forcefully grabbed her hand and took her to the other seat. He ran back to his, and Shweta could see his back was stiff. She was crying but realised that she couldn‚Äôt do anything at this point.

She saw two men barge inside the bus with wooden clubs and she could even see knife handles, from the knives tucked into their pants. One man was remarkably tall, with a thick beard and had a saffron towel around his neck. The other man was of average height and clean shaven. 

‚ÄúIf you cooperate, this will be over quickly and you can be on your way. I‚Äôm saying it now, don‚Äôt create trouble‚Äù the smaller of the two men announced.

‚ÄúAll the men come outside!‚Äù the tall man roared, so loud that Shweta flinched

She knew what this was going to be. She felt a huge pang of guilt. Her instinct of self-preservation took over. ‚ÄúNothing could be done‚Äù she thought. 

Five minutes later, she counted 18 men come back. They were one short.

She didn‚Äôt see Sumit come back. She felt the bus lurch forward and she immediately ran to the driver

‚ÄúMy friend isn‚Äôt back yet! Please! Don‚Äôt leave already, he must be out there!‚Äù she screamed

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not coming back *beta*‚Äù he replied calmly

‚ÄúNo no! He will come back!‚Äù she screamed at the top of her voice in desperation

She then collapsed to the ground, next to the driver howling.

\--

The year is 2038, in New Delhi, Hindustan. If you‚Äôre reading this from the past, you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs not called India any more. It all started in 2016, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a huge mandate and were lauded for their pro-development policies. 

Before I tell you what happened, let me tell you what else is going on with ‚ÄúHindustan‚Äù. What Sumit and Shweta went through is just one instance. This is happening everywhere. They can‚Äôt check women, but they check men if they‚Äôre circumcised. If they are, the women they are with are also taken. 

The government is condemning this, albeit very mildly and of course the PM keeps tweeting how sad he is and urges not to engage in violence. The government keeps insisting that they have no hand in this, but it is the work of ‚Äúmiscreants‚Äù that they aren‚Äôt able to control.

Starting with the protests that erupted in the erstwhile India at the end of 2019, it soon emerged that the BJP after winning their second election with a landslide, were now enacting their core ideologies. 

In Social Media, Narendra Modi always appeared to be a man who treated everyone equally. However, it was in rallies that his actual persona could be seen. Millions watched helplessly as he brainwashed thousands every week. The BJP realised that all they needed was to brainwash the gullible. To tell them that Hinduism was under threat. That our country was going to the Muslims. 

Muslims were accused so many things. The economy bad? They blamed it on them. They accused muslims of impersonating Hindus to get away and practice their religion secretly. This rumour became more widespread when Muslims were left stateless after the National Registry of Citizens was introduced in 2020. 

So many protested, but turns out they weren‚Äôt enough. Protests weren‚Äôt the only thing required. People needed to un-brainwashed. People needed a good pair of spectacles to see clearly. 

The hard truth was, the number of people who believed in ‚ÄúHindutva‚Äù outnumbered the others and this kept BJP in power. The BJP knew - all they had to do was campaign in rural areas and brainwash the gullible in the communally unstable places in India.

417lmk,thrownwa,Policy/Economy,Are investors using government's FDI policy to re-pump black money in to the economy? Possibly yes.,"Bringing FDI is the new mantra for developing Indian economy so much so it is now considered only occupation worth pursuing for Indian PM and FM. Indian PM Modi makes a round trip of the world with impressive slogans and grants to bring much needed money  but little does he know or care at least till now that most of the money that do come to our country is the money that we couldn't collect in the first place. 

While FDI may not be such a bad thing in itself, one still needs to ask what these all FDIs coming to our country consist of and where exactly are they going.

[Suspicious FDI transactions

>**If it is flowing out, why and how it is flowing back into India?**

>Answer: Black Money goes out of India for the reason of evasion of tax, however the money which flows out get‚Äôs negligible earnings on interest rates hence it flown back into India by various means to make an even bigger earning. **One of the important ways in which Black Money flows back in is the FDI route**.

>**Why would a country like Mauritius, which is primarily dependent on tourism and sugarcane able to contribute to about 40 percent of our FDI inflows?** Black money which flows out, goes into a Mauritian subsidiary of a Indian (any national) company and comes back into the stock market through FDI route. This is what is called as Round-tripping ie the whole conversion of Black Money into capital investments and returns.

I was wondering if the poeple of this subreddit could share some of their experiences teaching and attending STATE schools in India. Could you also share the issues no matter how small or big with the education policies regarding all education ( including the universities such as JEE-IIT) . So far, we have been to two churches in the UK where we held coffee mornings and sold home made Indian food to raise money for the charity and to spread awareness of the issues. So far we have raised around ¬£150 and gotten the churches to include it in their local newspapers and leaflets. 

If you have provided issues, thank you very much!

I'd also like for potential solutions you believe would have great impacts on educations as a whole in India. These could be solutions you have heard/seen being used in countries similar to India (culture/economic) such as China as they share many educational viewpoints and are both emerging economies.

ehjlce,Istradefylline,Policy/Economy,The Purpose of War (1984) - George Orwell,"The primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process ‚Äî by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute ‚Äî the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction ‚Äî indeed, in some sense was the destruction ‚Äî of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter‚Äîset him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ‚Äôthe proles‚Äô. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time¬†the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.",no one likes wars but the leadership and no one benefits except the leadership... ,/r/india/comments/ehjlce/the_purpose_of_war_1984_george_orwell/
ddoz4c,ppcontentrobot,Policy/Economy,"As an NRI, my personal view on the Serious emigration thread.","Here is the original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dcquo0/serious_emigration_threat_is_it_helpless_yet/

As a person emigrated to Germany, I want to chip in my personal view as to what it takes to make me come back to India. 

tl:dr; I won't be back as of now! May be in future!

Long version:

u/ozonised has compiled very good list of what issues exists and what can be improved.

Infrastructure: I come from Hyderabad and being a capital city the infrastructure is shit! It took more than 10 years and massive amount to build a metro, and that too it's over the top metro not an underground. The roads are already congested and these fools installed metro pillars in between the roads, congesting it even more. The city sewage is still from the Nizams era and nothing substantial has been done to improve it. Every year in rainy season, roads and buildings are submerged in water.

Ride bike for one hour, take a clean cloth and swipe on your face, a black layer come off. That's the pollution in the city. Auto and public busses emit black gases from exhaust! You are literally breathing that shit day in, day out. Just creating better transportation does not make a place livable. You need to plan for the future and build something sustainable! There is no greenery in the city and becoming concrete jungle! Every year when I visit Hyd, I regret roaming on the streets because of that black smoke.

Please make the city more livable. Yesterday there was news about cutting down trees in Aarey park, mumbai to make way for Metro! We need to progress and build infrastructure considering nature not the other way round. It takes just a strong will to inspect/make every person riding a vehicle to follows correct emission standards.

Healthcare:  
Healthcare is completely different topic. Last year, as a challenge to get an MRI for my Cervical Spondylosis problem, my father asked me to get it done in Osmania Hospital. I visited for 20 days and tried to get an appointment with a Neuro doctor and MRI without paying a bribe, sadly I gave up and got it done in a private hospital.

Have you ever visited the pregnant ward in any govt hospital? If you don't puke, I would congratulate you. Imagine women carrying a child for 9 months and then delivering among other 20 women in a congested room and pathetic conditions. Healthcare is literally on their knees.

- Did you know 2 years back Indian mangoes were banned in germany because they were using chemicals to ripe them! 

You know what can be done? Just a good officer and good inspection to keep premises clean and healthy. Checkout the amsterdam cycling documentaries, the govt responded to the public demand and created more cycling infrastructure, so that people can bikle freely and resulting in massive decline in health problems.

Academics: 
The plight of private schools looting parents came to mainstream due to Delhi govt. Kudos to them for bringing awareness. Private schools are robbing and public schools are getting closed due to lack of funds!! Govt has no money to run schools but they make a 3k crore statue. I saw some days back in UP, a school was serving rice with salt as mid-day meal. Are we in such a fucking pathetic situation that we can not give a curry/dal with rice for our future generations? Don't get me started on quality of education. Why can't govt schools have English subject? Why do they have to teach only in regional language? I saw many govt school students under confident when they start college.

In Germany I can study for free until my PG. I can work under professors and also get paid handsomely if I do research. You know what, as a student I pay just 52‚Ç¨(4000 INR) for one semester/6 months and can take part or play as many times. Open the following link with chrome and translate it. https://hsp-hh.sport.uni-hamburg.de/sportangprogramm.htm. It would be mind boggling to know every student in the city can take part in so many sports. You would be overwhelmed when you see the sport infrastructure this country has! I have never played any sport except cricket and thankfully to Germany I played so many sports you can't even imagine and that too almost free! 

You can also take as many courses you want by paying 110‚Ç¨(8k INR) for 6 months. When you earn more then 2.5k‚Ç¨ every month 110‚Ç¨ for 6 months is nothing! Why would I leave this and come back to nothing, where I can get sick just by breathing that shitty air?

Policies: Check out the startup culture here in Berlin and Munich area. In India, we have so many IIT's and lakhs of students graduating every year. What is stopping the Govt from creating a Startup fund and make policies that encourage the fresh minds to create fresh Ideas? They have a startup fund and I guess it has gone to the wind! 

Me, My elder brother and younger sister all are CS students. We are actually working on our startup that would be headquartered in Germany and branch out in India. Do you know why? because we get better funding here and exposure is fucking awesome! Every city has Startup hacks/meetups/pitches! I don't want to start our startup in the red tape of Indian bureaucracy. To be honest, It's a shame that in a country like India, we are lagging behind in Startup world!

Employment: Better startup policies, better infrastructure, better education directly leads to creating more opportunities! No magic wand. I am in my 20s and working on my company, there are lakhs of people like me, but sadly working that shitty 9-5 job in some big company. Just look around and see the jobs created by Zomato and Swiggy, the cash they brought into market from consumers. Imagine startups like these on a massive scale! It would change the face of our country. Our economy needs to be more open and welcoming!

My brother used to work in East Asia and came back to India and he regrets every day. The daily commute, traffic jams, pollution is literally killing him. As the first comment from u/mrfreeze2000 says, ""There are two types of people who emigrate: better pay/lifestyle, and better work"". I Emigrated because of both. You know Its Illegal to make me work on Sat & Sunday. If an exceptional situation arises that I have to work on Saturday, my company has to get permission from Labour office!

- I get 6 weeks of Paid holidays + public holidays
- I can travel 27 countries. Just pack your bags and hop in your car. Los geht's!
- I get PR after working for 3 years or 2 years with German B1 certificate. No Shitty visa issues like in US of A. 
- I can become German citizen in 6-8 years.
- I can take as many sickness leaves i want. It's my right. I dont do it, just saying.
- If my wife is working and expecting a child, she gets 14(fourteen) months of paid maternity leave. As a father you can also take paternity leave.
- My whole family is covered under my Health insurance covering from fever to cancer. 
- Children go to awesome schools here to learn, they can take music as a subject or any sport and all of this is free.
- If I ever got fired, I get arbeitslosengeld(Job Loss money), for 1.5 years I guess.
- Better infrastructure, better health and Hospitals, better care, better money, better air. 

Lastly, I guess this was written by non-muslim person(sorry to bring in Religion). As a muslim myself, my father urges me not to come back to India ever, given the cancer that has spread in recent years. I have desis saying to my face anti-national or paki here in Germany and least I expect that India. I stopped going to Indian festival gatherings here because I fear some dickhead will ask why I came there and what is my intention. Some years back I could trust my fellow Indians and now I lost that hope. Just for reference check this tweet (https://twitter.com/rohini_sgh/status/1180165971006197765), this is the cancer our country has acquired! You don't know the humiliation we are facing these days. Every damn thing has been turned into whataboutery. The current regime spined the propaganda about minority appeasement? What minority appeasement, muslims situation is worse than SC/ST's and that too without reservation. 

Why would I leave all these and come back to India to suck all that shit? I love my country and think of it now and then, but do I miss it? Nah! Do I miss the culture? absolutely yes! Do I want to come back and live there? Nope. Sorry.

Edit: Thanks u/kash_if for the silver!

c95ykl,MelodicBerries,Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",Is it fair to conclude that we are going more towards the Chinese model? ,/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/
e3b9rc,Rocky_since1951,Policy/Economy,"Guys, I am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of India!","We see poor people everywhere in this country, sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas, we see beggars trying to get a meal a day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat. We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!

d6vb4b,conqueror_of_destiny,Policy/Economy,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion."," ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",Again your faulty logic.

ch4zwd,billionaireinindia,Policy/Economy,[Rant] India‚Äôs BRUTAL tax for the rich,"To be honest, I feel this post applies to those who pay tax (regardless of which slab), I‚Äôm just putting stuff from my perspective.

There are no two ways to put it, India‚Äôs tax on the super rich is ridiculously high. I belong to that super rich community and while paying taxes is not an issue, the amount certainly is. Money doesn‚Äôt come easy and I‚Äôve worked hard for it. Meanwhile the government just gives us a big middle finger and increases the taxes. 

Now tell me why would anyone want to live in a developing country with such high tax rates. Before any of you‚Äôll hark on about patriotism and bullshit like that just think logically for a second. For the amount of tax (42.7%) paid here, you can easily shift to a country with lower tax rates. And with the kind of money people from my income category have I can see a lot of them leaving this country for good. 

The government is not incentivizing individuals to become wealthy. What benefits does being wealthy in India get you? Roads are shit, public infrastructure is lacking, incredibly high taxes for luxury items, the list goes on and on.... 
Instead they want to spend my money on statues, stupid ministries like AYUSH, scams, bailing out public sector companies and stuff like that.

Worse, so much money, which I GAVE as tax is being spent to appease the vote bank. Rich farmers are not taxed because the government is afraid to lose them. The individuals and companies who pay taxes (the 1%) have absolutely no say in policies because the government wants to use the money to appease the other (99%). (The figures are just examples). We are the source of that money. India is taking a turn to the socialist era, when taxes were even more exorbitant and India was a planned economy. I just wish the government would aggressively try to increase the tax base instead of strangling those who pay tax.

EDIT- I am NOT averse to paying high taxes in general. I already elaborated that in my comment below but in India, tax does not give benefits that other countries with similar tax rates give.","Agree with OP 100% . I see no change in quality of healthcare, education, and useful infrastructure ( roads, street lights, bridges, highways, police stations etc ). It was literally same 20 years ago. Why would anyone pay taxes? I am willing to pay 50% of my income but i want to see changes and i want to see it being used for welfare of others.  

My friend in Germany pays similar tax but Germany has free colleges, free healthcare and provides ‚Ç¨400 a month aid that can't support itself ( providing food, shelter, rent, water etc. State covers all of it. So the money is being used to educate people can't afford to and after years they will be able to get jobs, and pay for their own stuff reducing the dependence on welfare money. 

I get very few people pay taxes in India but we have it tough. If i earn 50k per month and want to support a family of 4, I can't. I don't want to live in a shitty apartment with a Activa. I'd want better quality life, do you know how ridiculous tuition and college fees are? I'd want to save money for it. I'd want to save money for my kid's wedding and help them complete their education. If state can't provide free Universities and jobs, I'd save my money to support them instead of paying taxes.

e5d76w,mrfreeze2000,Policy/Economy,Real Talk: India's economic future is screwed and no one can do anything about it,"I'm starting this based on an assumption: that the only way for lower-middle income countries like India to prosper is through a manufacturing-led, export-oriented economy.

This is the only proven model of prosperity in the 20th and 21st centuries.

This manufacturing can't be just any kind. It has to be low skill, high-volume in order to employ a large number of people. India's current manufacturing pattern is mostly filled with high-skill, low employment products like jewellery, medicine, cars, and software.

It's far easier to train 10,000 people to make iPhone accessories than it is to get them to make cars.

But this kind of high-volume, low skill manufacturing isn't coming to India, regardless of any policy push from the government. 

A few reasons why:

&#x200B;

1. Competitors in SE Asia a) have specialized in certain products (like garments in Bangladesh), b) have fewer roadblocks to investment from the populace (they are autocracies or pseudo-democracies), and c) have a cultural affinity with China (such as Vietnam) which makes it easier for Chinese manufacturers to move shop there.
2. Businesses are built on relationships, not just policy leverage. Policy makers don't get this because very few of them have ever run businesses. By now, American businesses have had decade-long relationships with their Chinese manufacturers. These Chinese manufacturers are now building factories in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If you were an American business, who would you rather partner with - an unknown entity in India, or the Vietnamese arm of the Chinese manufacturer you know and trust?
3. Supply chains are hard to build and harder to optimize. If you wanted to be a manufacturing power in 2020, you would have had to start work for it in 2015, not 2019. We've lost that moment.
4. India's regional inequality means that the states with cheap labor (Bihar, UP) are also the states where no one wants to invest in because of law and order problems
5. India's democracy means that everything becomes much more challenging for a manufacturer - land acquisition, labor issues, etc. Vietnam, meanwhile, can bulldoze whatever the hell it wants to bulldoze and put up a red carpet for manufacturers.
6. And this might be a biased personal take, but I've felt that Indian manufacturers don't have business competence. I've tried to build products in India as well as China. Our Chinese partners treated us as a small company that might later be a big company, and gave us that respect and priority. Our Indian partner treated us as a small fry and was more keen on getting short-term profit than build a long-term relationship.

I feel that the moment where India could be a manufacturing power is past us. 

Without manufacturing, you'll have a situation where:

&#x200B;

1. The state has to spend more and more on welfare to tackle unemployment among a young population
2. To pay for this welfare, the state will increasingly overreach in tax collection. You're seeing this already where a small section of the population pays nearly all the taxes.
3. The small portion of people who have good jobs will be increasingly resentful of their taxes being spent on welfare. This, coupled with environmental issues, will accelerate brain drain and capital flight.
4. Without the capital and manpower, employment generation will be even slower, forcing the state to squeeze even more. If the welfare dole stops, it knows there is going to be widespread unrest. 
5. All this welfare will tax the state exchequer more and more. We're seeing this already - the government has hit its fiscal deficit target for the year in just 7 months. 
6. One the welfare dole stops, tens of millions of unemployed, angry, poor people will only do what they can do: revolt.

 the right tor the left but there are certain things that I
 like more about each side. For example, the left
 believing in the rights of the LGBT community. But
 well, when Congress was in power, I was more on the
 conservative side because Congress really felt like a 
 ""pappu"" government in my opinion. I'm from
 Hyderabad, so, I never had to vote for Congress or
 the BJP and I'm happy about not having to choose
 one of them. Congress had some questionable
 policies but the situation the BJP has led our country
 into, I mean It's Outrageous.

 I've never seen Modi  commenting on the Unnao rape victim. I've never  seen him assure the country about the current economic situation. He simply doesn't seem to care. Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi. Such is the impression that our beloved PM has on the international stage. I don't know, I don't see these Modi praisers talking about the economy at all. I am a little inclined to the right more than the left but this is just shameful that this guy called Modi has led us into this pit. I've never seen him addressing the nation on the issues at ground level. All he does is spew out patriotic and emotional bullshit. I am patriotic and all but it alarms me that our PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslimcommunity's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities. Hell, I have so many Muslim friends, but growing up with them I've never felt the difference between my Hindu and Muslim friends. 

You see, with all these lynchings and forcing
 of Jai Shree Ram slogans has affected one way or the
 other. Before all this crap, we used to break each
 others balls, make fun of the religions and never got
 anyone offended. Suddenly, I look around now and
 we are still the same mates we were, but we think
 twice before bringing up a religious joke. That's what
the Modi government has given us. Everybody has
 the internet, everyone knows what's happening, this
 has to be addressed. Our country's economy, our
 secularism, our linguistic freedom, have all gone

The violence yesterday at JNU - as the police stood by and let it happen- is unbelievably tragic and heartbreaking.

Last 6 months have been really dark days for our democracy. Between the authoritarian decision to scrap Article 370 without any consultation from Kashmiri leaders or population; the rampant Internet shutdowns and Article 144 evocations; CAA/NRC and the police brutality against minorities; and the disastrous state of our economy, I think our Government has crossed a line.

I can no longer give them the benefit of doubt. We all stood by and let an asinine policy like demonetization happen, thinking it was just a misguided Government working for the greater good. We didn't even flinch as administration took no action against increasing communal violence, and recruited criminals and openly communal leaders. But it's not a time to remain apolitical anymore.

At this point, I firmly believe Government has run out of chances. If we continue to support it and do not protest against the blatantly unjust laws, we are looking at irreversible damage to our social fabric. The economy is already in a pretty bad state by nearly every metric except the top 20 companies.

I want our narrative to change towards ideas and policies that can help propel this extremely capable nation of 1.3 billion people to a brighter future.

I have attached a mock-up of how I envision the portal to look like. Key features:

* Sign up using Aadhar OTP
* anybody can view the discussion but to vote, comments and engage you need to sign up
* initially invite only for the best minds in our country
* people can submit ideas
* ideas segregated in a manner our central cabinet is segregated
* politics and religion agnostic discussion
* No advertisement

I haves full time job however I am extremely passionate about India and this cause. I am looking for people who can make this vision a reality. I need people who can code, I can myself do the designing (photoshop) and assist with the setting side of stuff. I need people to help me in marketing the platform as well to top minds of our country.

Anybody who cares for this and believes in this, please comment and DM me

Open to hearing your ideas, and criticism","yeah, what about it ? is your argument that we can't spend more because it will increase deficit ? that's ok but then there is no way we can have good education/healthcare similar to developed countries. right now we just spend too less on these things even when adjusted for gdp. Also i'm not even sure to amp up the education/healthcare spending we even need to increase the deficit - afaik we already spend close to 7% on defense (for comparison Germany - the powerhouse of EU - spends around 1%). I guess our priorities are just different. ",/r/india/comments/dkxdxm/coders_need_your_help_lets_help_out_our/
di5x69,ohdickens,Policy/Economy,[AskIndia] Why do we have so much distrust of Businesses and Markets?,"Was listening to a talk from Kunal Shah (founder of Freecharge and Cred) and found quite a few insights about the attitude of Indians towards generating wealth through businesses.

A few things really stood out. For example -

1. India has a unique MRP system for products found nowhere else in the world. It gives us the illusion that we are charged fairly for our goods but it works very counter-intuitively against the poor.
Because the rich pay almost the same price as the poor. A richer neighbourhood should have richer prices than in a poorer neighbourhood.
The manufacturer has to price the MRP at a rate higher than he would in a competitive market because he needs to make sure he covers his cost or overruns due to dead or destroyed stock.

2. How we, as Indians, value money over time. We would not pay for quality which saves us time but we will gladly buy sub-quality goods if it saves us money.

3. We question and probe profit percentages of each private company but have no clue about the efficiency of government spending and yet we keep clamouring for more taxes.

4. Pre-1991, we were poor and ridden with Socialist policies which championed the poor and the farmers and we went bankrupt. But after 1991, when we allowed foreign money to come in, we saw a substantial rise in the standard of living and goods.
Yet, we are still calling restrictions on foreign capital in e-commerce and retail which is just perplexing.

5. We think the private companies are out to loot the people of India and we think Adani and Ambani are rich because of Modi but it is, in fact, the lack of competition and implementation of endless rules and licenses that allow Adani and Reliance to operate in any field with almost no competition.


I don't get it. Is this an education thing? Have we been taught capitalism incorrectly? The numbers are so clear yet we are still stuck in denial about having government involvement in the economy. So many people flock to capitalist economies from India yet why do we trust the government so much?

And before anyone says, yes I do think Healthcare, defense, law and order should be under government along with economic incentives for education and research but beyond that, you don't really need government.","They think that other governments won't be the same. For example, communists who do not condone Stalinism (a lot of them do though), think that if there was someone else in place of Lenin/Stalin, they would have done things far better.

In short, people think that it is the individual government that is bad, not the government itself ",/r/india/comments/di5x69/askindia_why_do_we_have_so_much_distrust_of/
d76uvt,lightnh,Policy/Economy,Economic Shit Storm Incoming brace for impact : What failure of corporate tax rate may imply.,"Before getting bombarded, let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless, and I vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now. 

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.


Damocles Sword

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow. 



Global Currency 


INR will get devalued significantly to attract investment and will further push outward mobilisation.","Sigh, your positivity may be contagious ü§î*narrowed eyes* Time to get bio hazard suite lol. Regardless, war will increase gdp short term but will skew currency exchange value.

Remittance.... If they send anything back but again that will be counted towards NI.... Regardless, I have no data to back up my claim on decreasing remittance with increase in education or discontent.

Reservation has helped obcs exactly why sometimes their cut-off marks are higher than general category their starting point of economic status was different from sc/st. 


Looking at reservation as a poverty alleviation programme is wrong. Reservation won't fix poverty. It is to give discriminated communities what they lack ie representation and empowerment.

I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here. Thank you all for the support and understanding.","Lived all my life head down keeping opinions to myself.

eogkmk,VelvetHedgehog,Scheduled,Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals,"
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously ‚Äì something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority ‚Äì with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",I don‚Äôt see it as such a problem in Punjab. I suppose it‚Äôs because caste hierarchy isn‚Äôt as big of an issue as it is in other states. It‚Äôs an issue but not as prominent I think. ,/r/india/comments/eogkmk/vegetarianism_in_india_has_more_to_do_with_caste/

fdaht6,whatsappfactchecker,Scheduled,"Hi r/india, I made a bot to stop fake news on WhatsApp","[edit 3: looks like it's been blocked by Facebook. Fuck. I will try to speak to them about this]

As we all know, WhatsApp is a major source of disinformation in our country. To help mitigate this, I've created a bot that crowdsources information on fake WhatsApp forwards. It works with text, photos, videos, audio clips, etc.

Wanna try it out? **Send any fake forwards that you have received to +14704378045** (over WhatsApp). Please encourage any gullible friends you might have to try it too.

It's a little bit volatile at the moment (blame Facebook for making automation difficult) and goes down from time to time. Please be patient if this happens, it is scheduled to restart at 5:30 am IST everyday.

Comments and suggestions welcome.

Edit 2:
Many people are asking how the bot stops fake news, so I'm copy pasting my explanation here -

There are two main scenarios:

1. You receive a WhatsApp forward which you know is factually fake and want to report it. You can forward the message to this bot and report it as fake, and leave a note as to why you think it's fake.

2. You receive a WhatsApp forward and want to check if it's genuine before believing it/passing it on. You can forward it to the bot, and the bot will inform you how many people have reported it as fake and their reasons for doing so

Edit: Thanks for the gold!","I thought about this too.

eykwsp,ali_sez_so,Scheduled,Seattle city council becomes the first US legislative body to pass a resolution against CAA. Full video of the hearing and the vote that followed.,"This resolution was tabled on January 21st because some of the council members thought they needed to do more research after receiving an email from the Council General of India. 

It was scheduled for a hearing and vote at 2pm today. It has been a long and emotional day. There were around 200-300 people supporting the resolution and probably not more than 80 who were supporting CAA and against the resolution. They were in minority but were the loudest and were there at the city hall since 7 in the morning. Since they were first in line, they got to register for the hearing first and got the opportunity to speak. [Here is the full video of the hearing and the vote.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwygRQ6oXuQ)

One after the other they came and spoke lies about how CAA has nothing to do with Indians. They talked about how minorities are being prosecuted in Pakistan/Bangladesh, how women are being forcefully converted or raped in these countries, or how minorities went from 25% to 5% in these countries(without any source for that information). Some argued that Seattle should deal with its own problems of homelessness, drugs and crime instead of ""falling prey to hate-mongering"". One person even claimed that there is a [genocide of Hindus going on in India and the population of Hindus went down to 65%.](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=1920) Many people laughed at that. Some accused the council member Kshama Sawant and her political aspirations and her ""ulterior motives"" behind this resolution. Some even went on to claim that all these protests against CAA are sponsored by Pakistan/ISI. [And when there was finally a group to speak in favor of the resolution, the bhakts started heckling and shouting at them and the the hearing was suspended,](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=2798) which they knew would happen. When the hearing was resumed it was back to them and their lies.

After the public hearing, the council member Sawant [gave an amazing speech supporting the resolution](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=4463) and she was constantly being heckled. And then there was [this](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5106) comment from another council member who could see the bigotry through all the comments made by the bhakts.

In the end, truth prevailed and the council members voted 5 out of 5 in favor of the resolution. 

Right when it was apparent that the resolution was going to be passed, the bhakts started [creating a ruckus](https://youtu.be/WwygRQ6oXuQ?t=5574) and after multiple warnings, security was called and they were asked to leave the hall. The way the acted was embarrassing to say the least.","This is great. When given the opportunity, the bhakts' lies and bullshit were torn apart for all to see on a world stage.

f2y883,Zea-,Scheduled,Can Indians grow a spine already?,"I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go.

fqr5nq,mks7777,Scheduled,Does anyone know how the PMNRF that we are all donating to (Prime Minister National Relief Fund) is utilised?,"In last year alone, PMNRF had a surpluse of 570.68 crores in 2018-19. As per the FAQs section, these funds can be utilised for medical assistance, floods, drought, terrorist violence and other unforeseen occurrences. Indians who are either affected by these calamities or who require financial aid for treatment of major diseases at Government/PMNRF empanelled hospitals can partially defray the expenses. Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?
We keep getting posts on r/india of doctors working with limited resources and have a lack of proper protective equipments. Why haven't been a lot of these funds transferred in times of crisis or better, for improvement of healthcare facilities? 
Does anyone know about how these funds are disbursed? Is there any answer to why such a huge amount is kept reserved? Has anyone ever directly received financial aids from this fund?

7jhqsa,whiteobsidian,Scheduled,TIFU by being from a Scheduled Caste but apparently not looking like one,"Sorry for the dramatic title. Also as TIFUs usually go, this did not happen today but over a period of a month

A little background, I'm a 27 year old male, IIM passout. working in a well known consulting firm earning about 30LPA. I am a sincere, hardworking, simple dude. Since most caste related discussions always end up about reservation, lemme clarify that I never used it. Got 99.4 %ile in CAT, also had got AIR in 600's general in IITJEE. But here's the catch, despite being a Telugu SC, apparently I don't look like one. I am light-skinned and have good facial features I guess.

So I figured I was ready to get married. Since I had no luck on Tinder and was extremely busy to go out and find someone, I created a profile on one of those matrimony websites for professionals because I want an educated, broad-minded working wife. MISTAKE #1. Most of the profiles on there were of girls from highly educated backgrounds and thats the reason I thought I could find someone like me whom I could connect with in terms of principles, attitude toward education/work/life, my agnostic beliefs etc.

I checked the 'Any' option on caste as it doesn't matter to me and figured since this is a place for educated professionals, nobody really cares about caste. MISTAKE #2.

So within a week, I get a fair amount of matches. Some are handled by parents, some handled by the girls themselves. Here are some interesting experiences I had over a period of a month:

1) **Telugu Unkil**: Caste mentioned - Kapu. Says he is ""highly interested"" in my profile. I mail him back saying if he has any caste preferences and that I prefer open-minded people in general. Writes back saying how his daughter is very broad-minded, hates traditional mindset and they are looking for a very liberal family. I think great, I would like to know more about her and we started talking on whatsapp and we seem to hit it off pretty well. 5 days later she asks me my caste and I mention it. Ghosted. No replies, she unfriends me on facebook, blocks me on whatsapp. I move on.


2) **Gril**: Works for a big bank in Mumbai. Mentions 'Any' caste. So I think great. I message her and she accepts it. We exchange numbers and start talking. A week goes by, we have talked about our jobs, future plans, location preferences and want to schedule a personal meetup. She messages me - ""hey I think you should know this, I am from Teli caste which is OBC. Hope your parents are ok?"" I tell her I don't care and neither do my parents. Then I tell her about my caste, and she starts acting weird. Starts replying to my texts in syllables and tries to hang up on my calls. I feel bad and message her asking what ticked her off. She says that she thought I was from an upper caste and that's why she replied to my message. And now she doesn't want to proceed any further and want to cancel all further plans. I told her that it's a bit hypocritical of her that initially she was one wanting my parents to be ok with her being OBC when she thought I was from OC. 


3) **Marathi Auntie**: This one's a bit hilarious. She sends me a message saying she really liked my profile for her daughter. I look it up and sure enough - mentioned 'any caste'. I give her my number and she sends me a complete biodata about her daughter. Daughter is really pretty and from MDI Gurgaon, I think great. But she mentions caste as 'Rigvedi Brahmin'. I think oh f**k. I send her all the details, mention my caste and even bracket it with '(SC)'. Immediately she goes, ""I really like your profile. Tell me the next steps or give me your parents number"". I'm like - this can't be happening. Then it hits me that maybe she has glanced over the caste part in her hurry. So I send another text saying,- ""ma'am pls confirm that you have seen my caste, and it falls under Scheduled Caste"". Never heard back from her.


There are a few more like this. Most of the profiles message me about my caste and go silent when I mention it. I realized that all my life, my circle of friends have ranged from all castes, religions and financial backgrounds and they never made me feel like a dalit or whatever. I have lived a happy and fairly successful life. That was the reason I was ignoring the caste aspect for finding someone to spend my life. 

Now I have learnt my lesson and changed my caste to clearly say SC and will stick to my own I guess. I also feel like giving up on these matrimony websites. It's been a great learning experience about my position in the society folks! :)","If you don't mind me asking kaun jaat ho? I mean which caste?

Why I am asking is because most northies including Maharatrians won't know the Telugu caste hierarchy unless you tell them. 

So you can either say bluntly that you are SC or you can tell them in a softer fashion that your caste is classified as SC but it isn't comparable to northie hierarchy and also highlight your own achievements. I mean soften the blow.

Now I am going to  be criticised for what I said above as it's playing the caste game and not taking the high road. However caste is a reality. Also you have chosen arranged marriage route so you can't escape it. Also your own post starts with claming you aren't stereotyptocal SC and you want to play up that card.

fkql7h,2throwawaythrowaway,Scheduled,"[AskIndia] Fathers/mothers of Reddit India, what were the 38-41 weeks of pregnancy like for you? Long post ahead.","Hi everyone!

I am currently in my 25th week (late 2nd trimester) and I'm trying to educate myself about what lies ahead for me. I have to zero in on the most important decision - the city of birth (job city?/my hometown?/husband's hometown?). I need to decide this ASAP as traveling after 28 weeks(April end that is) is generally not advised.

Which brings me to making this post here. I want to gather all the information/anectodes/experiences, in a countdown way, about the D-Day/D-weeks. If the circumstances allow, I would prefer a normal delivery. However, I totally understand how uncertain pregnancies can get. I just feel being informed can help us stay less anxious & not panic. Its going to be long and my thoughts might seem all over the place, so please bear with me. Here are my questions:

1) How frequent are the scheduled* OB/GYN visits in the very last month, assuming a normal pregnancy? Currently I visit once a month, for routine check up and milestone/mandated tests (flu vaccination, various blood tests, sonography, etc)

*(By scheduled I mean no complication was experienced by the woman or any urgency(water breaking, bleeding, etc) occured)

2) One lady who had the same OBGYN as me when went for her scheduled 37th week visit, was told she will have a C-Section as the child is getting overweight (weighing 3 kgs then). The OBGYN asked her to soon decide which date she would like the surgery to happen and let the doctor know. The lady said she however got labor pain the very next day and delivered via vaginal delivery. Now, I am a little skeptical here; from what I've read, **2.5-3.5 kgs is the average birth weight for newborns in India**. How can 3 kgs be overweight then? I'm already very paranoid about the state of deliveries in urban, big-name hospitals and this incident scares me more. There is no data public on the number of normal and surgical deliveries a hospital has, so that one can decide, and once you're in, you're in. After that, you have to leave everything at the doctor.

3) One lady who delivered at the same hospital (different OBGYN) as me, went at 37 weeks when she felt contractions. Her cervix was examined twice in a 5 hour span. She said she couldn't bear going through that painful examination again and asked for a C-Section herself (totally fair). My question is, are these cervix examinations by hand so necessary, when they're leaving the bearing lady in pain? Is there no other way (imaging, ultrasound, etc)? My point is those contractions could have been what is called 'false labor' and if not for the pain due to the examination, that lady could have gone home and come again full-term or when she felt contractions again?

4) My sister went for a scheduled visit in 38th week. Her cervix was examined, she started bleeding. She was told to come back if bleeding continued till evening, which it did. She had to be operated the next day, after staying in labor room for some 24-32 hours. This again makes me skeptical about cervix examinations.

5) What's the countdown going to be like? When does one know that ""yes, its now that I rush to the hospital."" Should I be scared of just a few drops of blood? Should I rush the very first time I experience period like cramps? From my few interactions with mothers, I feel 37-38 weeks is the sweet spot where many things happen. I know my post gives a lot of distrusting vibes towards doctors, that they're there to loot us, they try to 'invent' some complication in these sweet spot weeks to push for C-Sections, etc. Trust me, I would like to be proven wrong. Hence, I'm here to collect as much anectodes about false alarms, doctor sending the lady home even after mild contractions as its not time yet instead of asking to schedule a C-Section, etc as I can.

5) From what I understand, some women might never experience labor even after 40-41 weeks and hence have to be induced. Are some women induced before that too? What could lead to induction before full term?

6) Do all women having a vaginal delivery get an epidural/other pain medication, or only those who demand it when they get tired, or when they can't bear pain?

7) Did anyone research natural birth centers? There are many in the major cities, like 1) Sanctum Birth Center, Hyderabad, 2) Birth Village, Kochi, 3) Daimaas Natural Birth Center, Mumbai, 4) Apollo Cradle, Gurugram. Google reviews are mixed. Anyone undertook the services of these natural birth centers?

So everyone, contribute what you can towards my questions & in general, your pregnancy stories.","Thank you for your reply covering all my questions.

> Depends on the risk factors. High risk pregnancies require weekly monitoring. Otherwise bi monthly suffice.

I think high risk would be 35+ age, woman suffering with thyroid problem/gestational diabetes and a few more problems. Right?

> 3 is average and is by no means overweight.

I knew it!

> Indian doctors love inducing women even when they are in labor to reduce the labor time which makes it much harder on the women

Can a woman fight against this? Like, if one is on the labor bed, do Indian nurses/doctors tell to the lady/husband what medication they're giving?

> Look up water birthing, think there's one in Kerala

Yes, its in Kochi named Birth Village. I am looking at such options. All are away from where I currently live and we'll have to look for accommodation options too there. It will be good to research how equipped they are with post natal care and NNCU, like you mentioned. May be a visit by my husband prior to taking the judgement call would help.

### So this is my situation


I on the last round of interview for an Irish company. And I don't have a passport yet ( I know it's dumb ). So I applied for the passport and went to the passport office today and my application got rejected due to the lack of identification documents.

I went there with 3 docs. Aadhar, pan And my sslc certificate.
I only have Aadhar, and pan card as identification docs. ( I have voters ID but the name in there is spelled wrong ). So the mam at the counter told me if there is any other documents I have, and suggested that I can get a online birth certificate. So I went to the near by Cafe and took a print out of the birth certificate. 

But in that, my name was given with out my initials. So the Assistant Passport officer rejected my application. 


So when I went back to ask what else I can do . The mam at the counter told me that if I applied for non tatkal passport I will need only two identification documents ( plus sslc certificate ). 

So I came back home and went to nearest *E-seva Kendra* to reapply for the passport in  non tatkal way.

## problem 2

Imagine my name is *Michael Jackson Obama*

So in my sslc certificate my name is written as *Michael JO.* And in my Aadhar and pan card it's written as *Michael Jackson Obama* . So he says that I cannot apply passport like this. I have to change my name in the sslc certificate to match my Aadhar. 

*Q1:* But the passport officer didn't mention any of these. Is that. Problem ? 

Changing my name in my sslc could take up to a couple of weeks. But if it takes that long I could lose my job.

I currently don't have licence. 

*Q2:* what are my options for getting a passport ASAP. ?


**Edit :- 10/03/2020**

I went to meet my uncle's friend who has some knowledge on these things. 

So I have been told that there will be no problem for me to apply passport via non tatkal route. 
Since my name on the PAN card and Aadhar is just expanded form of my name in the sslc certificate. So that won't be a problem. Appointment for the passport office has been scheduled at 16th March so I will post what happens next.


**Edit :- 16/04/2020**

I finished the interview in the passport office with out any trouble. They asked me which name I want in my passport. **Michael JO** or **Michael Jackson Obama**. So the whole process was over under 45mins. So waiting for police verification now.",Congratulations. ,/r/india/comments/ffvwej/serious_can_someone_please_suggest_me_a_way_to/
fl8lmk,Dark_Ruler,Scheduled,Appreciation to Maharashtra Government,"Read the post-script if you feel that I am wrong at any line. (Post Script is at the end)

I am neither related to any political party nor I want to support or say bad about any Political Party. This post is just to appreciate Maharashtra Government and to give reason for people in Maharashtra to support the Government to fight against Coronavirus.

The steps that Maharashtra Government took to fight against Coronavirus may look drastic and unnecessary but I wish to say something about it. Many developed countries like USA, Spain, Italy etc. have taken these measures after the virus spread. In Maharashtra as of today morning, according to news channels, although there were 49 infected people, 40 of them came from other countries and just 9 were the ones who were in contact with the affected. For a  heavily populated country like India, these numbers are almost unbelievable. If the government did not take such drastic measures, these numbers would not have been so small. I agree that these measures disturb our schedule and many think that this is just a step by Medical Industries to increase income but WHO wouldn't have taken the steps during already going on recession.

These numbers are better than many Developed countries. We have to appreciate Maharashtra Government for their hardwork and co-operate with them. If everyone cooperates with the Government then Government will surely loosen the restrictions and we will have less trouble. 

Don't overestimate your immune system and don't assume that you won't get infected. Just follow the instructions given out by the Health Minister.

Important controversial Judgement: Justice Goel‚Äôs judgment on prevention of misuse of SC/ST Act in Dr. Shubhash Kashinath Mahajan vs. The State of Maharashtra, is one of the much talked about decision. Justice Goel along with Justice Lalit examined the question on the inclusion of procedural safeguards so that the provisions of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) (SC/ST) Act 1989 are not abused for extraneous considerations. The Bench held that, a Government official cannot be prosecuted on mere allegation of committing an offence under the Act without the sanction of appointing authority.¬†[1](https://www.indialegallive.com/constitutional-law-news/courts-news/justice-ak-goel-retires-from-sc-defends-his-judgment-in-sc-st-act-51270) [2](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-ak-goel-who-ruled-on-dalit-atrocities-law-retires-from-top-court-1879280)

>*High court judges are appointed in the following way: The state government sends a list of names through the governor to the chief justices of the Supreme Court and the concerned high court. This list is then sent to the law ministry, which obtains an IB report on the nominees. Thereafter, it prepares a matrix with three criteria √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù professional competence, integrity and political links.*  
>  
>*In the case of Goel, the law ministry matrix contains no entry under the ''Professional Competence'' column, while the ''Reputation/Integrity'' column bluntly says: ""Corrupt person"".*  
>  
>*The key to his subsequent appointment appears to be the listing in the political affiliation column, which notes that Goel was¬†general secretary of the All-India Adhiwakta Parishad, the lawyers'' wing of the RSS. Curiously, among the five short-listed advocates whose integrity the IB had questioned, he was the only one cleared by the ministry.*  
>  
>*Having sent back the file once,¬†Narayanan¬†had the constitutional obligation of approving the appointment but he made his unhappiness clear.¬†The President¬†noted: ""Nonetheless, I feel that a more desirable course of action would have been to follow the same procedure as was done in a similarly placed case of the Calcutta High Court where the advice of the Chief Justice, which is integral to the selection process, was sought again and duly received...I would also appreciate if my instant observations are shared with the Chief Justice of India along with my earlier observation dated May 3, 2001 on this matter.""*

Well, none of these are wrong to someone who considers RSS-BJP as a group run by pristine men.

This series is not for them, but for those who have recognised the RSS-BJP as fas\_ist forces but fail to understand what went soo wrong with our great judicial system.

PS: This series is heavily influenced by Caravan Magazine report¬†[In Sua Causa. What the judiciary has done to itself-ATUL DEV](https://caravanmagazine.in/law/what-judiciary-done-itself)

###","No, parts of this was in Caravanmagzine. But since the article is lengthy (10s of pages and paid one), I thought I'll do some more research and put it out here!

The question kept bugging me for says:
How can such powerful Supreme Court act like BJP's personal court. I beleive many do have that question. It required lot of digging around on internet. So I thought if starting this series.

ftifyl,automatedbanana,Scheduled,Trip Advise: Uttarakhand/Himachal - June or later - 2 people - 3/4 days,"Hi,

I'm planning a honeymoon trip to either Uttarakhand or Himachal for me and my fiance (Provided Corona settles down). These two are the places that we're interested in right now, but suggestions are welcome for any other hillstation/scenic places too. Budget is around 50k flexible for 3/4 days and 3/4 nights.

Even though Shimla/Manali were common choices, it looks airports are far from these places and I don't wanna sit in bus/car for 9hrs+ straight. I'm looking for places which have airports much closer and Dehradun came up. I was thinking of may be covering Dehradun, Nainital etc. in June.

1. Are Dehradun and Nainital good for a peaceful honeymoon trip? I'm not looking to cover a lot of places with a tight schedule. I'd rather visit a few calm and quiet scenic places and spend a bit of time there.
2. Is the weather nice there in June or will it be too hot? Also in case Corona situation continues how's the weather during July/August? I don't wanna extend it too much to really cold weather either.
3. I'm planning to book hotels on my own and hire a cab with driver for the duration. Any suggestion on this? Looking for reliability more than anything, since this will be our first trip I don't want any hassles as you can imagine. Or any reliable packages that I should look into?
4. Any other scenic places near to these locations that I must visit? Like I mentioned before I don't wanna spend a lot of time in car especially if the terrain is rough.

Thanks you for reading and sorry for the long post.","yes, not married yet. Marriage and honeymoon are dependent on Corona situation and we're praying for everything to calm down before June. ",/r/india/comments/ftifyl/trip_advise_uttarakhandhimachal_june_or_later_2/

### 1)¬†SARS-¬≠CoV-¬≠2¬†

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer¬≠reviewed, open¬≠access journal ‚ÄòEmerging Microbes and Infections‚Äô has cautioned that SARS¬≠-CoV-¬≠2, the virus causing the COVID-¬≠19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-¬≠2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What‚Äôs more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID¬≠19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ¬≠fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ¬≠ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ¬≠ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‚Äòsevere condition‚Äô. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019¬≠nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.¬† In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world‚Äôs largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world‚Äôs population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force‚Äôs fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

edeet7,lolwtftheyrealltaken,Scheduled,I Am Amazed and Inspired by Indian Youth,"I myself am not an Indian national. Rather, I am an American-born Pakistani. I have subscribed to this subreddit because I think it's important to understand the other half of the discussion. 

I don't want my idea of what Indians believe to be made up entirely of my family's steriotypes of what this community is. 

In addition to being of Pakistani descent and from a muslim family, I am also gay. I was shocked when India legalized gay marriage. I always thought Pakistani and Indian culture to be so similar. This was what piqued my interest in India. I wanted to gain a greater understanding of the mentality and political compass of Indians as far as I could understand it through Reddit (which I understand is not necessarily demonstrative of the majority of Indian voters).

Countless times I have been inspired by the Indian Reddit community's relentless efforts to cling to the secular identity of Indian political culture. Time and time again, I read about Indian pride for being the largest democracy. This is in most cases, within the context of a diverse community. People of every faith and every ethnicity all as Indian citizens sharing a common but spectacularly diverse culture.  

I am so glad that I chose to follow this subreddit or I probably wouldn't know that there is in fact a very large population of Indians who object to islamophobia or racist views of the vast subcultures of India. 

So I just wanted to thank everyone who stands for the Indian cultural ideal of tolerance and inclusiveness. It's very inspiring and I hope that bigots around the globe can learn a thing or two from this.

Edit: It has been pointed out that in fact gay marriage has not been legalized, rather, sodomy has been decriminalized. I stand corrected and apologize for this misconception.

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo.","Having frequenct orgasm DOES REDUCE prostate cancer risk: https://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/726363?keywords=orgasm-prostate-cancer-men&year=2016&month=04&date=28&id=726363&oref=www.bing.com

f9a1i5,TheFatherofOwls,Scheduled,(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck Here,"Alright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",Thanks again. ,/r/india/comments/f9a1i5/confession_kinda_stuck_here/
ea0iu4,kindasapien,Scheduled,Indigo flight to chandigarh overbooked passengers stranded.,"So, flight 6E 592 from Bangalore to Chandigarh Indigo airlines has been overbooked by indigo. These guys came to know about this when boarding bus was at the door of aircraft with 50-70 passengers still in boarding bus. 

We have kept the flight stranded for now.

But such irresponsible behaviour from indigo has left all of us in jiffy. We are standing at tarmac currently.

Will update.

Please upvote this for visibility. These are such malicious practices. How can they have overbooked so much.

Update1: so indigo guys scheduled same flight to two different places instead of two. And passengers for other location (I couldn't get that) have not be allowed to board.
Now they have boarded all the Chandigarh passengers.
But rest are still stranded. I am on board but still there are atleast 30 people stranded. This is some pathetic show by indigo

Also I am not sure whether i will get my luggage today.

Okay will update after I reach Chandigarh airplane mode time. Hope these guys don't remain stranded here for long.

Real shit show by indigo

Update 2: Reached Chandigarh got my luggage.

About the whole fiasco. Seems like those passengers were going to Amritsar and Indigo cancelled their flights and tried to put them on Chandigarh flight and a further passage to Amritsar. Now due to almost complete show by Chandigarh passengers ,Amritsar guys were stopped from boarding.
TLDR: seems like indigo miscalculated the no show and caused stranded passengers
 Edit: https://www.flightstats.com/v2/flight-tracker/6E/592

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of ‚ÄúThe Way Things Were,‚Äù which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as ‚Äúthe best Indian novel of the last decade.‚Äù
> His other books are ‚ÄúStranger to History: A Son‚Äôs Journey Through Islamic Lands,‚Äù a Costa-shortlisted first novel, ‚ÄúThe Temple-Goers,‚Äù and the highly acclaimed ‚ÄúNoon.‚Äù He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India‚Äôs divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST.

fe9bye,TheFatherofOwls,Scheduled,(CONFESSION) In a Dilemma,"Alright, this is a follow-up to a post I made a week back regarding me feeling stuck in a job that I really like but also, one that expects me to show up for work all 7 days.

I seem to have trouble giving a link to my first post here as upon posting, I get a message saying that it is awaiting approval. Been trying to do it for a couple of hours and I felt by then, the post would have gotten stale and old to be seen by others, in the feed.

A few days back, while leaving for the day after de-briefing with my boss, he noticed me looking tired than usual (really was dull and tired that day) and told me if there's anything wrong with me. I told him there's nothing wrong but he insisted. Since it's been only 3 months since I joined work, my probation period was coming to an end. I told him that whatever issue that I have, I'll discuss with him during my performance review that would have likely been conducted after the probation got over.

But, he insisted sharing whatever was bothering me and thus, I spilled it out - that a 7 day working schedule is too much for me to handle and that I might not be a fit in this industry (note that I've mentioned ""industry"" and not the ""company"") in the long run (It's a food and beverage industry). I told him a day off in a week is all I expect. For which, he told me that he is fine with me taking a break every week as long as I don't take it on a Sunday, as the production team too, will start demanding days-off.

I guess, it is kinda reasonable but still, I find it odd that there's no day-off by default and that I have to take one from my part. But that's kinda resolved, right? Except this isn't the problem.....

When he inquired me as to what my long-term goals are, I told him (and have told him prior, even on my interview) that my endgame is to become a professor in the field of Humanities or a psychologist. He kinda dismissed that desire of mine and told me flat-out that I am not a ""professor material"" as I am shy, reserved and socially awkward who lacks people skills. He told me that the role that I am in, right now, is what I was made to do due to how good and ""exemplary"" I have been, in these three months it seems.

He broke down in detail and gave (what I feel) was a worst-case estimate as to how my desire won't work out for me and told me that he too was in my place when he was my age - confused and ""lacking a sense of direction"" and told me as to how he earned this place due to sheer hard work and asked me data to back-up my claim of becoming a teacher, when I told him my desire was purely based on intuition (he told me to not ""hide behind such a pretext"").

Honestly, I felt humiliated, insulted and destroyed after the conversation. This is the first time someone is telling me that I am not a professor material. As, based on previous interactions with some of my classmates, friends and even my teachers, almost everyone agreed that I have what it took to become one. But, boss was a highly educated guy who has had tons of XP with life and is sitting in this position out of his sheer hard work and dedication and so, he implied that by not taking his advice, I am losing a great opportunity and going on a path in ruining my life.

I felt so patronized and the entire conversation reeked of condescension, from his part. I literally could not tell anything from my defense and told him that I'll prove him wrong somehow.

Tbh, I never even told that I was planning on quitting....all I said was that the schedule was too much for me and so, I'll give a few more months only after which, I might call ""quits"". He told me to quit asap if that was the case, as he does not wish to invest and spend any further on me as it was go to waste, once I quit and thus, he'll have to find another one and have to start the entire thing from scratch all over again. Which is very understandable and fair, as I never thought about it from that perspective.

Honestly though, I did not know quitting a job will be this emotionally draining and intensive. I thought it would be cold, formal process but no....they patronized, guilt-tripped me and made me feel absolutely terrible and worthless.

He has given me two days time to come to a conclusion and based on what I wrote in my previous post, I am still stumped and at a loss in taking a decision based on the perks and privileges I enjoy here. But the whole interaction has left me with a bad taste in my mouth - no one patronizes me and dictates me into telling what I should be and what I cannot be and insult, mock and belittle my desires and dreams under the pretext of being ""honest, rational and practical"".

Maybe my desires are impractical but, it could have been broken down to me in a better way.

(Sorry for the long post and please read my previous post that I have linked in the first paragraph, to get a better context).","> You need to find a mentor that aligns with your career path.

Funny, that's exactly what he told me too.....finding a mentor. But yes, I do agree with you on this, I guess. It's just in the process of being under a mentor, I hope I don't lose my individual identity and my ideals and principles that I've been living till this point in my life.

> Not to some random office manager at a company you've been working for 3 months.

Well, he's the CEO of a very nascent startup and I am reporting to him directly as I am the only person in my department and don't have any seniors or managers who monitor or micromanage me.

But yes, he's a wonderful guy otherwise. Just feel that he could have broken down his dissatisfaction with my desires and decisions better, I feel. ",/r/india/comments/fe9bye/confession_in_a_dilemma/

**tl;dr ‚Äì if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

Big fan of this sub. It's been really great to read news about India and be able to discuss it. 

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. My family is from Kerala and I grew up in Hong Kong. After my primary and secondary school there, I ended up going to the Bay Area for university. After 7 years in the Bay, I moved back to India in order to work (believed that there were interesting things happening in consumer tech).

I‚Äôve also had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

What really helped me was moving back to India and being able to talk to a therapist who could understand the specific cultural issues that I was going through. I didn‚Äôt have the greatest relationship with my parents and it was sometimes really difficult to get a handle on my more negative thought patterns. My decision to move back to India was also really hard - lots of family members questioning my sanity and a lot of self doubt (am I stupidly just chasing risk?). Finally, I had a lot of insecurity about how I looked because I was usually the only brown person in the rooms I was moving in (and Hong Kong is not the most accepting place for people of colour).

**What I‚Äôm trying to do**

After having spent time both abroad and in India, I realized that there weren‚Äôt that many therapists abroad that could understand where I was coming from and that my Indian therapist was a lot more effective because of our shared cultural background.

I‚Äôm currently trying to see if other people feel this way, so here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I‚Äôll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what‚Äôs effective and what‚Äôs not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you‚Äôre facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person.

If you‚Äôre in the US, you unfortunately **can‚Äôt use** this service because of regulation. If you‚Äôre in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai‚Ä¶you‚Äôre fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",I did! Hopefully it gets some traction. ,/r/india/comments/ffwh0m/mental_health_therapy_service_for_nris/

3h81f0,28mumbai,[R]eddiquette,What positive culture did the Muslim conquests of India bring to India - how have Muslims enriched India historically ? [R]eddiquette [Discussion],"Was just wondering this - as I was reading about the university of Nalanda and how it was (thought to be) ransacked and destroyed in 13th century (1200 CE).

In the fields of philsophy, art, science, and culture what positive enriching things did Muslims (Turks, Afghans, Persians, Pashtuns, Mongols etc...) bring to India ?

Please keep discussion civil.

Also, suggestions for crossposting to other subs where this may be answered more thoroughly?

Another question : what were negative aspects of the Islamic invasion of India ?

","Hah. They actually borrowed our math, philosophy.

I'd even say that they got their sufnsm from india. The concept of 100 names of allah is not in koran. Its a later evolution, and I suspect copied from vishnu sahastranama.

I have strong aptitude for graphic design, having freelanced for quite some time. However, like all Indian parents, my parents want me to do an Mtech, that too in Civil. The problem with that is that Civil is a relatively low paying job for a very long time. I have an offer from a startup which pays higher than the current engagement, but since neither is core, my parents aren't very supportive. I have decent aptitude for marketing too, and was looking at a marketing MBA I am looking at three vastly different fields RN, Graphic design, MBA, Mtech in Civil. Pls advice","I honestly don't understand how forcing a child to do what you think has more money, will make the child happy?

From my experience, I will say that please, only do a Masters in something, if you're genuinely interested and motivated to pursue that subject. You don't just go to an institute, get a degree and then are inundated with buttloads of money. It's hard work. You are developing a finer specialization in a field. And if you're are genuinely not motivated, it can end terribly.

The most important thing right now for you, I think, is to carefully think which profession you want to get in. Money is an important criterion, but I think the 3 fields you mention, they all pay well and sufficient for you to live comfortably. The most crucial question is: what work do you enjoy? What do you see yourself doing for years, day in and day out? Sometimes you will be thinking about work during your free time. Which of those 3, Graphic Design, MBA and Civil, do you see yourself giving your all? Something that you can work on, for hours and hours?

My background: I went into engineering, against my father's wishes. He wanted me to go into medical, and I sucked in that. You can imagine the drama that ensued because of my decision. He was threatening to disown me. The whole Indian TV soap drama.

Then I went abroad for Masters in Theoretical Physics. This was something that developed gradually. I kept asking ""why?"" to engineering questions, delved deeper and deeper, and got hooked on Modern Physics. I naturally wanted to do a PhD, and got a scholarship for that. Now I have a good job abroad. It's not all rainbows and roses. Some days are really damn hard and it's a pain to get through the work. But at the end of the day, I am still grateful I took this path, made my own decisions, and live the consequences.

This is your life. You are the one who will actually have to do the work. Your parents/uncles/aunties/friends *might* think that this is better for you or that. But you are the one who has to live your entire life on those decisions. Why not make an informed, well-thought one? Understand the future prospects of those professions, what you want with your life, and which one aligns the most closely with your ambition and desires. Best of luck, OP.

In light of the upcoming coverage of the election results (both real and exit) we believe the following would be the best way to cover these elections at /r/India:

* On the evening of the 12th (5pm IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the results of the various exit polls. 

* On the morning of the 16th (8am IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the actual results of the elections. This thread would contain the link to two separate threads - one for the results of the Lok Sabha and one for the results of the state legislatures that are going to poll. 

These threads (the exit poll thread, and the thread for results of state elections and lok sabha elections) would be created by /u/megathreadbot (same bot which helped us out in covering the assembly election results in December 2013). Any user would be able to add updates to the body of the text post. 

The threads would be [R]eddiquette enforced and no name calling / personal abuses will be tolerated. All news items related to the election results should go in these threads. Please don't create separate threads for them. This will help in consolidating the discussion in a single thread.

**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).

the story was a tragic love story published in 10 standard textbooks for SSC (Maharashtra board) and it was set in an office. the protagonist falls for a woman in his office and attempts to communicate with her, i think, through her lunch box. leaving message in it, that sort of stuff if i remember correctly, but i could be wrong. he keeps doing this but the woman never reacts. i guess it ends in sad way and they part ways without ever speaking a word.

I think AAP is going sell out the country.  The way it is coming out of nowhere with seemingly clueless people, yet managing to win election and get the media to keep praising it... that takes a very high level of skill in the game... which I frankly do not see in AAP.

This is also not getting much news coverage.  

This sort of thing is the reason why India and China haven't resolved its border dispute Because India can not resolve it.  

China has resolved All of its Land borders in a 3 decade blitz. Except India and Bhutan(which is also because of India)  

India can't even get to terms with Bangladesh and it took 40 years for India to enter negotiation with a neighbor like Bangladesh in 2011 on the border issue.  

PRC settled those 12 borders and only 2 times got about 50% of original claimed land, rest were all around 5-20%, meaning it gave land concessions on Every deal and it settled because PRC leadership and the other country both had Govts/Leadership which were either totally Authoritarian or partially.  

India has not had a single party majority Govt since 1980's. This is the real reason why talks have not gathered momentum because India can't do anything even if it wanted.  

Indian domestic public, political and legislative system presents great challenges to such a topic.  

I predict the next time ANY single party Majority comes into power the Indo-China border will be resolved within 5 years.","The whole thing is ridiculous:The kings of Cooch Behar and Rangpur betted them on card games(a couple of centuries ago),then Rangpur joining (erstwhile) Pakistan,leaving WB with a chicken-neck border and these enclaves...
